# surge-synthesizer.github.io

This repo just hosts the static HTML I want to serve up as part of the READMEs and so on for my various
projects. Remarkably uninteresting!

If you have Docker installed, you should be able to run the project by switching to the root dir and running:

```docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/usr/src/app -p 4000:4000 starefossen/github-pages```
