Welcome to the Surge Nightly Build. You can download the nightly build for any of our supported platforms here. 


But before you do, please take a moment to understand the nightlies. We automatically build Surge on all our 
platforms with every commit to our <a href="https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge">main</a> branch. This means
the code you are about to download may be minutes old. Depending on the pace of development in the Surge team
the code could contain bugs, contain new features which don't work, and may even end up making patches that
future Surge versions load differently, incorrectly, or not at all.

Our minimum advice if you use a nightly is to <b>use a limiter on the output</b>. We have made DSP errors in the nightlies
which have made nasty clicks and pops.

But despite the above warning, we work really hard to have the nightlies be great. Most of the Surge team runs the nightly in their
music making environment and the software is generally stable and robust. Also, using the nightly, finding a bug, and letting us
know is how bugs get fixed. For more on that, learn how to <a href="/feedback">contact us with questions and comments.</a>

We keep a nightly changelog up to date by hand. It can lag the actual nightly by days or weeks, but is available
<a href="/nightlychangelog">here</a>
