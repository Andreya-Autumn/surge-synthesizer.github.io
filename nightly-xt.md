This page allows you to download the Surge XT Beta. Surge XT installs with a new plugin ID,
so you can run and test it side by side with Surge 1.9.

See our draft nightly changelog for Surge XT <a href="nightlychangelog">here</a>.

As of this writing, we still have a few features we are working on, especially around completing
some of the screen reader support, but would like to get it in people's hands for testing.


You testing the beta is how the release gets good, though! We need and welcome your feedback, either on [GitHub](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues) or
[Discord](https://discord.gg/aFQDdMV). Also, even though the beta is in pretty good shape, it may still have bugs.
Please be careful, use a limiter, don't use in-ear headphones when experimenting and so forth, in case we
have made a DSP error and you run across it!

<!--
## Caveats

Please take a moment to understand the nightlies. We automatically build Surge on all our
platforms with every commit to our <a href="https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge">main</a> branch. This means
the code you are about to download may be minutes old. Depending on the pace of development at Surge Synth Team,
the code could contain bugs, new features which don't work, and may even end up making patches that
future Surge versions load differently, incorrectly, or not at all.


Our minimum advice if you use a nightly is to <b>use a limiter on the output</b>. We have made DSP errors in the nightlies before
which created nasty clicks and pops, in worst cases sudden blasts of noise.


But despite the above warning, we work really hard to have the nightlies be great. Most of Surge Synth Team runs the nightly in their
music-making environment, and the software is generally stable and robust. Also, using the nightly, finding a bug, and letting us
know is how bugs get fixed. For more on that, learn how to <a href="/feedback">contact us with questions and comments.</a>
