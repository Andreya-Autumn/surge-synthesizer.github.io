Larger bugs fixed

-   SLFO modulating effects ignored the output ‘index’ meaning formula modulator worked incorrectly in vector output
-   When acting as an MTS-ESP source, the UI needed to be open to send tuning updates.
-   When saving a patch, if the documents directory was non-writable, surge could crash

Smaller fixes

-   Correct the TouchOSC menu name
-   Make the scene mode menu match the ui
-   Allow type-ins in the step sequencer to accept fractions (1/12 for instance)
-   Type-ins in the step sequencer return keyboard focus to the modified bar
-   The BBDEnsembleEffect implements `sampleRateReset` correctly allowing sample rate changes in a single session
-   The formula debugger UI could crash when swapping to an MSEG
-   The iniitFM2 template had waveshapers and filters deactivated mistakenly
-   The multi-switch supports mouse wheel properly in the skin engine
-   CMake has an option to turn off `-Werror`
-   The radial ‘stretch’ option in the tuning editor now has a minumum repetition interval of 100cents, avoiding a stuck scale situation
