Surge XT 1.3.1 contains bug fixes to the 1.3.0 release and a continued expansion
of our OpenSoundControl support. It also provides a broader set of choices
for Linux users who want to download a binary as opposed to self build.

This nightly changelog draft is up to date as of 729635323d429 / Feb 5 2024

## Open Sound Control

- Allow an output host other than 127.0.0.1
- Support a set of messages for observing and setting modulation
- Improve and expand outbound messages allowing surge to work with TouchOSC
- Fix an udpate bug where Solo/Mute would update the engine but not the UI
- Consolidate the various OSC settings into a single settings screen in the UI

## Improvements for our Linux Binary consumers

- Restore our build pipeline to Ubuntu 18.04 / gcc 9 with a docker image, lowering the LIBC requirement
- Add a suite of OBS Builds (insert link) for the entire rest of the zoo of configurations we mis-label with
  the singular noun 'linux'
- And that means we have a nightly and release linux aarch64 build ready for your ARM device!
- Along the way, apply fixes to allow the LV2 to build in CI. Although we still have better behavior in
  most settings with the CLAP or VST3 plugin, the LV2 is now in the binary bundle again.

## CLAP Upgrades

- Upgrade CLAP to 1.2.0
- Implement the CLAP `preset-discovery` and `preset-load` API. 
     - This means tools like BitwigStudio and
       MultiTrackStudio have access to the entire set of factory, third party, and user presets in the DAW
       and can create a track with a preset loaded. 
     - Try it in a recent bitwig! Install Surge 1.3.1, wait 10 seconds, and all your presets will be in the
       preset browser!
 
## Audio / DSP / Modulation bug fixes

- Ensemble Effect clock rate lower bound clamped to avoid underflows. Feedback summation
  corected. Both of these could create sound changes with the Enmsemble effect.
- Sine oscillator more continuous/accurate when modulating feedback through zero.
- Retriggering AEG and FEG with modulators now properly obeys trigger-from-zero/trigger-from-current
- Defensive check for bipolar determination in twist engine avoid occasional crash
- Clamp twist oscillator frequency lower bound to 2hz
- Consistently clamp String oscillator to delay line length, avoiding problem with very very low frequencies
- Fix a bug where allnotesoff would occasionally miss a note.

## UI Bug Fixes

- Imporve patch comment tooltip display
- Switch time based display units to ms when below 1 second
- Correct a tune-button-click behavior
- Create an undo entry for value typeins. How could we have missed this!!
- Tuning Editor Keyboard can now play notes when clicked
- Cmd-Click or Cmd-Shift-F10 in the patch browser opens the menu with just user patches, not factory or third party
- Fix an off-by-one error which made the Tuning Scale Rotation show the wrong tone by one key
- Changing an FX type clears modulation again (which broke with XT 1.1)
- Undoing changing an FX type restores modulation!
- Swapping or Moving an FX preserves mouldation muting
- Fix a problem where MSEG ticks at time < 0.1 phase would not draw vertical lines
- Fix a problem where a certain series of deletes on an MSEG could leave the loop ui in an invalid state, causing a crash.
- Formula modulator asks if you want to close when closing the window with unapplied code using the 'X'
- Formula modulator debuger shows rate/deform etc... values changing as you drag a slider in the main UI
- The filter analysis window no longer mis-focuses the filter 1 button when opened
- Make the Favorites and Find button in the patch selector keyboard focusable and accessible
- Alert OK/Cancel boxes respond to Return/Escape key press more intuitively

## Infrastructure and Code Cleanup

- InnoSetup / Windows Installer shows a Surge themed banner in the install wizard
- Fix MSVC stdext::checked_array_iterator warnings
- Use clang-format 17 to check formatting in CI
- Fix a build problem with gcc7
- Allow the linux 32 bit early-fail warning to be bypassed
- Add bluetooth permission text to the standalone app, fixing a crash on macOS 13 in some cases
- Integrate (but do not activate) the superparasites firmware for clouds/nimbus
- Add guards for LV2 headless builds
- Split SurgeGUIEditor meny functions to a separate file
- Improve the time taken to rebuild the SQLite patch db used for rapid searches
- Add a mod edit Begin/End to the modulation change listener
- Allow tests to build if LUA is not available
- Update code headers to reflect 2024 copyright
- Be a bit more pedantic/explicit about the in-place constructor strategy with SurgeVoice,
  squashing a debug-only memory leak in some MSVC debug settings, but also making the code
  a bit more correct.
- The surge-xt-cli with open sound control quits propelry on linux.
