1.3.2 contains small bug fixes mostly, but one or two more medium-ish ones. Last edit at
 851a4d989f2714f4 / May 6.

We fixed a few larger bugs:

-   In some situations, Surge would not operator with the FPU flags set properly, leading to bad performance
    in some models at very low levels.
-   SLFO modulating effects ignored the output ‘index’ meaning formula modulator worked incorrectly in vector output
-   When acting as an MTS-ESP source, the UI needed to be open to send tuning updates.
-   When saving a patch, if the documents directory was non-writable, surge could crash
-   Windows users with a corrupted and non-resolvable `%DOCUMENTS%` path now get clearer error messages and a more
    usable synth

We moved the OpenBuildService URL to no longer be a `baconpaul` URL but instead be
a `surge-synth-team` URL and updated our links.

We added a bunch of OSC features to cotinue making Surge Open Sound Controll usable

-    Extended parameters fully supported via OSC
-    `/wavetable`: selection, echoing, response to query
-    MIDI-style controllers (`/pbend`, `/cc`, `/chan_at`, `/poly_at`)
-   ‘/doc/param/…‘ parameter documentation messages sent with parameter queries
-    `/tuning` output (echo of gui changes, response to query)
-    Parameter changes caused by VST3 automation are now echoed to OSC out.
-    Echoing of FX deactivate is now sending correct scene/FX#
-    `/patch/load_user` and `/patch/save_user`, accessing user patch area
-   Correct the TouchOSC menu name

The CLI recieved a few key upgrades, including improving logging, fixing some
shutdown calls which were missing, and more.

Smaller fixes

-   Make the scene mode menu match the ui
-   Allow type-ins in the step sequencer to accept fractions (1/12 for instance)
-   Type-ins in the step sequencer return keyboard focus to the modified bar
-   The BBDEnsembleEffect implements `sampleRateReset` correctly allowing sample rate changes in a single session
-   The formula debugger UI could crash when swapping to an MSEG
-   The iniitFM2 template had waveshapers and filters deactivated mistakenly
-   The multi-switch supports mouse wheel properly in the skin engine
-   CMake has an option to turn off `-Werror`
-   Store tuning aplication mode in dawExtraState appropriately
-   Fix a scanning error when patch directories contained symbolic links
-   Fix a category display for categoties with more than 256 patches
-   Improve error handling for unopenable patches and other path related errors
-   Adjust some compiler flags anticipating a move to C++20 in the near future
-   The radial ‘stretch’ option in the tuning editor now has a minumum repetition interval of 100cents, avoiding a stuck scale situation
-   Standalone tempo is saved to a patch
-   The enter key works on number fields properly for consistent accessible access
-   Added the developmen tool, melatonin inspector, allowing ui debugging by devs
-   The tape effect handles sample rate changes properly
-   Ensemble effect adds an output reconstruction filter
-   MTS/ESP tuning and channel per octave mode conflicts resolved
-   Patch search uses a broader query to find more patches, including categories
-   Clean up some host-provided VST3 menus to be more consistent
-   Add a build time option to expose factory presets as JUCE presets at the synth edge
-   Fix some edge cases in modulation string display related to underlying second/milisecond display switching
-   Linux patch resolution uses the same Windows portable mode, if desired
-   The AEG and FEG can gate rather than fade their release stages, allowing other release fade strategies in patches
