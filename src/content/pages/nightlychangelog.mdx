Surge XT 1.3.1 contains bug fixes to the 1.3.0 release and a continued expansion
of our OpenSoundControl support.

This nightly changelog draft is up to date as of 14417985f77 / Jan 21 2024

## Open Sound Control

- Allow an output host other than 127.0.0.1
- Improve and expand outbound messages allowing surge to work with TouchOSC
- Fix an udpate bug where Solo/Mute would update the engine but not the UI

## Audio / DSP / Modulation bug fixes

- Ensemble Effect clock rate lower bound clamped to avoid underflows. Feedback summation
  corected. Both of these could create sound changes with the Enmsemble effect.
- Sine oscillator more continuous/accurate when modulating feedback through zero.
- Retriggering AEG and FEG with modulators now properly obeys trigger-from-zero/trigger-from-current
- Defensive check for bipolar determination in twist engine avoid occasional crash
- Clamp twist oscillator frequency lower bound to 2hz
- Consistently clamp String oscillator to delay line length, avoiding problem with very very low frequencies
- Fix a bug where allnotesoff would occasionally miss a note.

## UI Bug Fixes

- Imporve patch comment tooltip display
- Switch time based display units to ms when below 1 second
- Correct a tune-button-click behavior
- Create an undo entry for value typeins. How could we have missed this!!
- Tuning Editor Keyboard can now play notes when clicked
- Cmd-Click or Cmd-Shift-F10 in the patch browser opens the menu with just user patches, not factory or third party
- Fix an off-by-one error which made the Tuning Scale Rotation show the wrong tone by one key
- Changing an FX type clears modulation again (which broke with XT 1.1)
- Undoing changing an FX type restores modulation!
- Swapping or Moving an FX preserves mouldation muting
- Fix a problem where MSEG ticks at time < 0.1 phase would not draw vertical lines
- Fix a problem where a certain series of deletes on an MSEG could leave the loop ui in an invalid state, causing a crash.
- Formula modulator asks if you want to close when closing the window with unapplied code using the 'X'
- The filter analysis window no longer mis-focuses the filter 1 button when opened

## Improvements for our Linux Binary consumers

- Restore our build pipeline to Ubuntu 18.04 / gcc 9 with a docker image, lowering the LIBC requirement
- Add a suite of OBS Builds (insert link) for the entire rest of the zoo of configurations we mis-label with
  the singular noun 'linux'
- And that means we have a nightly and release linux aarch64 build ready for your ARM device!
- Along the way, apply fixes to allow the LV2 to build in CI. Although we still have better behavior in
  most settings with the CLAP or VST3 plugin, the LV2 is now in the binary bundle again.

## Infrastructure and Code Cleanup

- InnoSetup / Windows Installer shows a Surge themed banner in the install wizard
- Fix MSVC stdext::checked_array_iterator warnings
- Use clang-format 17 to check formatting in CI
- Fix a build problem with gcc7
- Allow the linux 32 bit early-fail warning to be bypassed
- Add bluetooth permission text to the standalone app, fixing a crash on macOS 13 in some cases
- Integrate (but do not activate) the superparasites firmware for clouds/nimbus
- Add guards for LV2 headless builds
- Split SurgeGUIEditor meny functions to a separate file
