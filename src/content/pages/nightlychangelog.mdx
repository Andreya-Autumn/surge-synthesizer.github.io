# Nightly headed to 1.3 change log

We plan to release Surge XT 1.3 sometime in winter 2023.

This is up to date as of Oct 31 / 829f483a6104

## Open Sound Control

-   Surge adds a complete open sound control implementation. For more information, see _what??_
     Basically I skipped all the OSC changelog entries so we can just write summary here

## A CLI / True-Headless Synth

-   we added a pure CLI/No GUI version of the surge synthesizer for total headless playback
-   surge-xt-cli (on linux), the cli executable in the standalone bundle (mac). Windows users must
    download separately
-   Combined with Open Sound Control and MIDI Program Change support, this allows a variety of
    new and useful embedded and headless performance options

## New Effects: Bonsai and Audio In

-   Write this

## DSP Additions and Changes

-   The Digital Ring Modulator (RM1x2 and 2x3 in the mixer) gains a large number
    alternate combinator modes.
-   FM3 M3 frequency extendable down to 0.5 hz
-   Oscillator initialization ignored the octave setting. This caused a very small initial
    gliss in the String and (in some cases) modern oscillator. Correct this to remove the
    gliss
-   Sin, FM2, and FM3 get a 'vintage feedback' mode (right mouse the Feedback slider) using a
    longer feedback window for slightly smoother feedback results.
-   The default Comb Filter buffer is twice as long (4096 samples) allowing lower frequency
    physical modelling at high sample rates. Self builders can reduce this size if they need to
    preserve memory through a CMake switch.
-   Reverb 1 Size can be modulated without resetting the network. Sounds kinda odd but kinda fun.
-   Fix a half-sample initial phase offset error in Modern when retriggered from zero

## Tuning-related changes

-   The tuning editor gets two new visualizations. The "True Keys" mode shows actual keys depressed and the
    interval betwene them. The "Radial" mode changes to "Polar" with both a "Radial" and "Angular" mode.
-   The tuning editor converts into a tuning analyzer in MTS-ESP mode, showing the new True Keys mode against
    MTS-ESP sources
-   Option to blanket ignore ODDSound-MTS removed.
-   Disconencting from ODDSound-MTS on an instance-by-instance basis is remembered in teh DAW state
-   Misleading tuning-related type-ins in 'tune-after-modulation' mode now present accurate errors
-   When channel 2/3 for scene mode is off, use MTS-ESP channels for tuning information

## MIDI and Performance Changes

-   Support MIDI Program Change
    -   The user patch directory contains a `MIDI Programs` directory
    -   Patches in the top level form a bank 0 if present
    -   Subdirectories form bank 0 ... 128 if no top level patches present of 1...127 if so
-   Support MIDI learn on all channels by channel
-   Disallow learn on reserved MIDI CCs
-   Dual scene mode in MPE and Latch-with-23-routing-off mis-released voices,
    leaving the non-active scene playing on release. Correct

## Other Changes

-   Patch Save Factoriy Overwrite available with shift-alt-click
-   Clap Parameter Menus work
-   Clap remote-control pages get an initial implementation
-   CLAP polymod works properly with per-channel and per-key polyphonic modulation, whereas
    previously it just worked per note
-   Standalones with a non-null playhead still ignore it and use the standalone tempo
-   Show input latency when block sizes are not power of 32 on the audio-input oscillator and FX
-   Use built-in windows for all alerts and notifications, no longer using the JUCE generic alert
-   XY drags in the filter window send VST automation events as well as modifying the filter
-   Multuple virtual keyboard layouts
-   Remove an unused button from the keyboard shortcuts editor which mis-read with screen readers
-   Limit wavetable load dialog to .wav and .wt only
-   Hide custom menu icons when menus are in accessible-expansion mode
-   FX Swap with drag and drop participates in undo
-   Add an unassigned-by-default but bindable key for random patch action
-   Fix a problem with the use of bold fonts in menus which mis-render menu headers in some macOS situations
-   You can mute an entire scene with the scene volume parameter
-   Disconnecting from MTS-ESP in a single instance is stored in the DAW state
-   The Standalone application works in FullScreen mode. Choose "Zoom/Enter Full Screen" to try.
-   The Oscillator Display uses the half rate filter to show the waveform, which shows a
    more accurate waveform in a couple of (high noise FM) cases.
-   Buttons on the oscilloscope and a few other places use correct hover-off color
-   Fix several points where the MSEG could generate or persist NaN values in the editor
-   Swapping macro modulators gesture participates in undo
-   Change to correct typein width in error case
-   Surge FX bank standalone works with mono-in stereo-out bluetooth configs
-   Update the lifecycle of the juce look and feel, avoiding a font crash in some rare cases
-   Handle filesystem errors more robustly and improve error reporting at startup, avoiding a filesystem crash in some rare cases
-   Tweaks, layout, and upgrade improvements to the formula editor
-   Update the character filter to allow inclusion in VCV Rack as a Standalone
-   Re-enable VST3 Parameter Menus in reason, now the underlying bug is fixed. Thanks to the Reason
    team for their Beta Program access to help find this bug for the Surge team!
-   Fix a bug with mouse position in horizontal sliders when unhiding mouse which could lead to
    positioning very close to the neighboring slider inappropriately
-   The return key on a step sequencer launches the edit gesture, matching other accessible sliders
-   The sustain pedal works in an omni fashion in channel-per-octave tuning mode
-   Zip file skin imports ignore the `_MACOSX` directory appropriately
-   Fix the link to the skin library in the synth
-   Use consistent phaser waveform names
-   Changing the OSC type or the FX type sends the appropriate begin/end edit information to the hosts
    for VST3/CLAP/AU parameter invalidation and OSC message creation



## Code Factoring and Quality

-   A large number of efforts went to moving code from surge into libraries shared between
    surge and shortcircuit including:
    -   moving many effects to the sst-effects library
    -   moving fundamental operators to the sst-basic-blocks library
    -   each of these moves included code improvements of various forms
-   With JUCE 7, remove the modibund per-type class extensions
-   The entire code base has uniform file comments and header guards
-   Centralize our locale based formatting using the libfmt locale
-   Remove some uses of `shared_ptr<T[]>` which dont work with the VCV Rack build environment
-   Make sure we properly obey `__restrict` on gcc
-   Consistently use `uses_wavetable` for all queries about wavetable usage
-   Fix an assumption about parameter layout in FXStorage
-   Fix a collection of typos across the code comments
-   Fix an error where MSEG Y-position tooltips would not update; or would show inappropriately
-   Refactor the modulator name API to be available to more code paths


## Infrastructure and Internal APIs

-   Upgrade to JUCE 7.0.5 (plus a couple of accesibility patches)
-   Remove the LV2 from the binary distribution
-   Tweak our CI/Azure strategy to improve time from commit to nightly
-   Innclude the mistakenly unincluded for gcc13
-   Surge builds on RPI on 64 bit OS but not 32; fail the 32 bit raspberry pi build earlier
-   Expand documentation about polypohnic modulation, about raspberry pi, and others
-   Move to catchv3; enable CTest
-   Improve unit test runtimes
-   Move minimum CMake version to 21
-   Move macOS notarization from altool to notarytoool
-   Consistently build for macOS 10.9 across all sub-modules
-   Fix compile on Clang 15 on macOS
-   Add an API set to end notes jsut based on note id
-   Add a test suite which compiles 'after' surge-xt as opposed to 'after' surge-common. use for OSC tests
-   Remove more inappropriate legacy SSE includes, allowing portability to more architectures with simde
-   Fix descriptions in Linux installers to indicate no more LV2; and inclusion of a CLAP in binary.
