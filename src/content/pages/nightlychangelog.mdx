We are approaching 1.4.0.

1.3.4 cherry picks some commits from main into a release, so 1.4.0 isn't just a linear diff
from 1.3.2.

All diffs after aed97a26 / Nov 29 2024 are in 1.4.0 only. Here's the diffs prior to that
in 1.4.0 which are not in 1.3.4 (that is, the cherry-picked-diffs are removed from this list).

Obviously this needs to be cleaned up, but doing the work to find the diffs was the start
