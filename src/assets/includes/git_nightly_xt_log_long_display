Restore python builds, macos, post JUCE8 upgrade (#7939)

This commit restores python builds post JUCE8 upgrade, although
it only tests it up to the point of building, not running.

With this commit

cmake -Bignore/noj -DSURGE_SKIP_JUCE_FOR_RACK=TRUE -DSURGE_BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS=TRUE

will create a cpython lib

Addresses #7934
