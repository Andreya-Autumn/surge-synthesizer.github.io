More Formula Subscription Changes: Timing and Voice (#7358)

* More Formula Subscription Changes: Timing and Voice

1. Timing is always subscribed, including "release" which is
   whether the LFO is in the release phase

2. The voice subscription is (1) always on for voice, (2)
   always off for scene but (3) no matter what provides a
   state.is_voice which is true or false.

* - Also add defaulted clamp_output to state

* - Update tests to new semantic for is_voice
