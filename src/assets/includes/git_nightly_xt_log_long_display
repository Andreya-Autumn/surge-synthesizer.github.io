Broaden search over query (#7566)

* Broaden search over query

Sometimes query criteria is not written on patch name. Thus, It'd be nice to also search on path name, which holds category info, additionally to patch name. Thus is specially useful for users for filtering Keys, Polys and so on.

* A similar approach to put in parent paths

by traversing upwards and breaking out

* Remove author level on search dir

In order to focus strictly on Category and Patch, we remove the
author name.
