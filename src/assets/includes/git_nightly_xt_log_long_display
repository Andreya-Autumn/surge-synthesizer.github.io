Remove libsamplerate dependency (#7728)

After porting Nimbus ot lanczos in 4b3ffe6 we can now remove the
libsamplerate dependency altogether as long as we fix up the twist
fm (which we did with a simple application of another lanczos ds)
and remove src code from the unit tests (where it was explicitly
tested)
