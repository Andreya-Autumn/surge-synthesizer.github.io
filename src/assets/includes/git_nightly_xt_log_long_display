Fix a crash-on-jog when wavetables not available (#7348)

If running surge with no wavetalbes, you get one and only one
wavetable (sine to saw) from memory so the system works.
But the jog buttons still went looking. Specificall, actually,
they didn't try and load anything but they did try and accessibily
announce the name. So move that announce block into the success
block.
