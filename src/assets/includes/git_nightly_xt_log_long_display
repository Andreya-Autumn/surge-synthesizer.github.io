Remove null pointer checks when the pointer had already been used. Th… (#7852)

* Remove null pointer checks when the pointer had already been used. The code would have caused a crash before the null pointer test if it'd ever occur, so presumably it doesn't.

* Correct a static analyzer result

* more storage checks downstream
