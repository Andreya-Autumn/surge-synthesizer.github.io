Fix up tests; Move CMake version to 131 (#7505)

d09e88aa5f086746bf0ad9d1cbe725909f8bfeda introduced new templates
with better levels. The tests used the templates. That got merged
as a content change. Blammo

So move the old init patches to the test directory and load them
from there so future improvements to the templates wont blow
up the tests.
