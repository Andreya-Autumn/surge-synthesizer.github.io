Rework the Windows ZIP phase to have a portable zip (#7320)

Previously we had a pluginsonly zip. Now we produce two
zips; A pluginsonly zip with the plugins only and a second
portable zip which adds the resources in the appropriately
positioned "SurgeXTData" directory next to the assets, with a
brief README copied in.

Closes #7313
