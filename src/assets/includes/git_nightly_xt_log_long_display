Modbuttons UX improvement (#8017)

* Reverted to 26 in surgestorage, as it wasnt suppose to increase in my previous PR.
* Fixes glitchy behaviour when mouse-dragging a modulation button
* adds state to modulation buttons that saves its current modulation index
* button state is cleared when loading new patch/initialise

* fix state clearing

That explains why only the first 3 lfos were cleared
