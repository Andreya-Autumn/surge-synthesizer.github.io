Dragging a non-mod param in mod mode now allows undo (#7642)

Dragging a non-modulatable parameter (like, say, FM2 M2 ratio)
with modulation armed (so like Macro green) meant the change neither
correctly fired a start/end param change gesture nor participated in
undo, since the control begin/edit only looked at armed state, not
armed and modulatable. Fix.
