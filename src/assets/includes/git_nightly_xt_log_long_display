Pull Request moves to Github Actions (#7733)

The PullRequest support of our azure pipeline is now on GitHub actions, building in various configurations and running the tests. The azure pipeline still exists to trigger the release stage, which is what I'll port tomorrow, or maybe thursday, and then be done with the azure->actions project.
