Work on improving the wavetable evaluator (#7882)

* Work on improving the wavetable evaluator

1. Step one: Make the evaluator an object with internal details
   state so we can move towards init and so on.
2. Add an init fn which can set shared state across all frames
   and also currently set the name of the object
3. Improve error handling, code clairty, arguments, internal
   state, etc...
4. Change the example to show these new features including
   using the name 'wt' and using a clearer set of names
   (but keep the old names silently present for now)

Addresses #4539
