Fix problem with FX Unit Typein and OSC (#7704)

1. Messages through trigger update used the old value to
   repaint the display, which caused issues with OSC and
   other automation paths (less so)

2. Type-ins via the parameter mechanism when using the
   ported-to-sst-effects effects with param metadata
   worked with in-app typeins but not with from-daw
   typeins since string to value onto in that case wrote
   the wrong item. Remediate.
