Pybind: Add ability to process inputs (#7673)

* Pybind: Add ability to process inputs
Added extra function called processMultiBlockWithInput on Python side which takes two arrays, one for input and one for output. This copies data to the SurgeSynthesizer input array before processing.
Note that the input and output arrays must match in size, type, and dimensions.

* surgepy.cpp: applied clang-format

* AUTHORS: Added Daniel Hatadi
