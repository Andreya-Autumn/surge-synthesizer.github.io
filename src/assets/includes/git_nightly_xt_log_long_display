Changed the cli midi behaviour (#7560)

* Changed the cli default behaviour:
- midi is off by default
- specifying a midi device checks for out of bounds index
- requesting all midi devices adds all available devices, which may be 0.
NB both may be enabled at the same time. If the specified device is not
present, this still fails despite the all-midi flag.
