Currently used tempo is saved to patch (#7546)

* Currently used tempo is saved to patch
It is only loaded in standalone, and only if the "Tempo on patch load" option is set to override.
This option only shows in standalone, too.

Closes #7529

* Don't clobber the typein with refreshes
Also update storage.unstreamedTempo when updating standaloneTempo

* Fix default value for tempoOnSave if it didn't exist when unstreaming
