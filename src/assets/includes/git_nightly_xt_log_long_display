Upstream OBS Patches to 1.3.0 (#7457)

This diff upstreams three patches used to make OBS build
across various unixen

1. Add -Wno-date-time to gcc (supress-errors.patch)
2. Add cstdint to cpufeatures (include-cstdint.patch)
3. Make the xt tests optional under SURGE_BUILD_TESTRUNNER
   (will allow us to retire disable-tests.patch if
   we add -DSURGE_BUILD_TESTRUNNER=FALSE to the build command)
