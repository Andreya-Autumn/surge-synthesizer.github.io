Additional OSC port input error checking (#7496)

Disallow OSC in and out ports to be the same.
Only allow numbers (and numbers+dot for IP) in text input fields.
Refactor input validation happening on text editor focus lost into a separate method and use it when pressing Enter in text input fields, as well
