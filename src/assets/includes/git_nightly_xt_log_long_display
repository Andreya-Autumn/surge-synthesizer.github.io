Refresh solo button on OSC Message (#7438)

The solo button is non-local and so requires a rebuild when
it changes. The various mechanisms we have do this but OSC
did not. So start a list of param types which when OSC set
push a rebuild and add solo, mute, and scenesel all to them.

Closes #7417
