Clap 1.2.0; Preset Discovery; Improved PatchDB Scan Times (#7466)

* Clap 1.2.0; Preset Discovery; Improved PatchDB Scan Times

- Move to clap 1.2.0 for clap-juce-extensions and so on
- As a result, implement the now non-draft preset-discovery
  API so surge exposes presets to bitwig, MTS, etc...
- And implement the non-draft preset-load API so bitwig, MTS
  etc can force surge to load
- Add an optimization i found in preset discovery to the
  patch db scanner also, reducing SQlite rebuild time

Closes #7269
