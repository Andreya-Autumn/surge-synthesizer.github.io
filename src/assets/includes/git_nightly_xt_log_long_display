surge-fx: split ParameterPanel into its own component (#7951)

* first pass, compiles

* rename to ParameterPanel

* compiles but segfauts on setStyle

* i regret making this commit this big but this removes StyleConsumer (not needed) and reverts resized to the original format

* match the UI to the original

* new line to fix clang

* add back accessibility order feature

* clean up headers

* why is there as semicolon here

* self review + why are there headers in the cmake sources

* yeah it builds fine without the headers in source

* fix ubuntu build

* fix ubuntu build 2
