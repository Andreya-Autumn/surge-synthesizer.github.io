Wavetable Option Plubming (#7785)

* Wavetable Option Plubming

This makes the Wavetable Morph option available and sets up
options for future changes too if we want.

Critically it doesn't *do* anything with the deform state it
just versions and edits it appropriately.

Addresses #7784

* Move menu from choice to binary
