Invert cli log level logic (#7541)

It is normally expected the incoming log level, via parameter or
configuration, to dictate how the current the set of log msgs are
to be shown. If cli in invoked with VERBOSE or TRACE level, all msgs
up to that level are shown. Otherwise, if it is said to be BASIC, only
msgs with such level should be displayed.
