Add the FX Group name to the end of Accessible sliders (#7284)

* Add the FX Group name to Accessible and VST3 names.

so rather than getting "channel, mix, channel, mix" you get
"channel - Left, Mix - Left, Channel - Right, Mix - Right"
etc. (VST3 uses Left - channel; Mix - channel instead)

The implementation of this is kinda gross, but that's part of
the sturcture of the fx. Along the way add a single function
go to param index to group index.

Closes #7238

Also add the FX group name to the VST3 parameters
