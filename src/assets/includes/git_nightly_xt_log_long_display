Deal with CLI/OSC crash due to active state being mis-set (#7780)

the CLI has a separate runloop than the SSP which is fine, but
that means it has to set the state. it didn't set active processing
and that meant OSC tried to do a non-audio queue drain. Which
combined with the audio queue drain went blamtastic.

Closes #7779
