luajitlib update build environment  (#7695)

This commit changes the liajit build (mostly on Linux and win, but in a few ways in macOS) to be more consistent with the built in luajit build tools which do not support cmake, allowing an easier path to a luajit upgrade 

* Polishing, documentation and various fixes
- Moved CMake error handling and debug to seperate functions
- Surrounded CMake path variables with quotes where needed
- Fixed missing error variable initialisation in shell scripts
- Renamed LuaJitLib folder to luajitlib and updated .gitmodules and src/common/CMakeList.txt
- Added README.md
- Various small style changes
