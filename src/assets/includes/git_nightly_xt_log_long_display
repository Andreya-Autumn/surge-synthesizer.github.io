Global (so SLFO -> Effect) modulators use index correctly (#7533)

Global (SLFO->Effect for instance) modulations ignored the
source index in the routing table, always picking index 0.
This meant, for instance, an indexed formula modulator couldn't
modulate an effect reliably (it always picked output 0) and also
things like env/wav would not work on regular lfos.

Closes #7531
