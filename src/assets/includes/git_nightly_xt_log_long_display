Prettify host context menu for Reaper (#7620)

Removes repeated parameter name in ugly square brackets in Reaper case.

This unfortunately had to modify the semantics of SurgeSynthEditor::modifyHostMenu() to work with a copy rather than a direct reference, since I didn't see a way to remove a menu entry when working with juce::PopupMenu::MenuItemIterator.
