Remove some unnecessary dynamic vectors/strings (#7862)

* Eliminate dynamic vector & string storage where there's a simpler alternative.
Code tweak in prepareForEvaluation to use logical OR rather than bitwise and const the initial bool variable.

* Pick the nit.

* Fix issue with constexpr of initializer_list that MSVC doesn't object to.

* Restore named sandboxWhitelist, & sandboxLibraryTables.
More ref usage.
2 functions can be static.

* format
