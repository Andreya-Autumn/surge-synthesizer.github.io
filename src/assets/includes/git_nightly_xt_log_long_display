Modern retrig-from-zero sample offset (#7218)

The modern 2-point DPW algorithm uses points at phase, phase-d and
phase -2d to calculate. This has the defacto one-sample latency
effect (at the oversample sample rate).

This doesn't matter *except* in the retrigger-from-zero case when
that shift makes the first output point at the wrong phase.

So in retrigger, intiialize phase to dphase, not to 0, so you
can hit the zero point for symmetric waveforms exactly.
