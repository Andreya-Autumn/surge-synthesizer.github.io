Copy and Paste Scene includes Global Modes; Insert FX (#7312)

Copy and Paste a scene now includes the following

1. Any scene -> global modulators (like SLFO1 to global volume)
2. The insert FX chain
3. Any modulations to the insert FX move from A to B on paste so
   the topology remains

Closes #7166
