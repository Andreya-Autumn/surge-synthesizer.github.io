Drain the osc ring buf without audio (#7446)

When audio isn't running the osc ring buf just fills up.
Like we do with other things use the audio processing active
bool to drain on the osc thread. There's a tiny race condition if
you are processing an osc message while you turn on audio but
leave that edge-case-of-an-edge-case in a comment

Closes #7445
