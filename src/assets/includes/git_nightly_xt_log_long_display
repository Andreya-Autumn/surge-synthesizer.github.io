Add help button to OSC Settings dialog (#7502)

Also make it so that juce::TextEditors in OSC Settings, Patch Store dialog and Tuning Editor get their selection removed on losing focus, which removes the vestigial 50% opaque selection rect that is annoying.
This still needs to be done for Category typeahead in Patch Store dialog, because it's a different widget.
