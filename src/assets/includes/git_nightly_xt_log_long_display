Move Params to have an SurgeSynthProcessor vs a SurgeSynthesizer (#7627)

this allows access to surge still via the ->surge member
(which we actually cache on the param to avoid changing too
much code) but allows a future where you can do OSC on
VST3 etc changes.

There's no functionality change here. But comments implyign
how it would work
