Lua code editors indentation (#7890)

* It's not possible to indent lines even if they are empty
* Tab does not indent the entire line anymore, instead it adds a tab at the caret position
* String declarations are autoclosed now
* Auto-indentation for function, while, if statements.
* When pressing Enter, the new line will keep the indentation from the previous line
