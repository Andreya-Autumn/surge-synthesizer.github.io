OSC enhancements: wavetable selection support, etc. (#7603)

* Adding /wavetable support to OSC

* Cleaning out some merge gark that snuck in

* one more cleanup

* /wavetable OSC functionality now includes /id, /incr, and /decr input messages for changing wavetable on a given scene/osc. Querying of current wavetable also supported.

* Refactored some confusing variable naming that reflected old structure to something much simpler and more logical.

* Updated OSC specification

* Caught two place where changing wavetables were not getting echoed to OSC (loading by filename and accessible "increment").

* Spec tweaks

* Another spec. tweak
