Lua debugger addons (#7990)

* Lua debugger addons

* Variable groups. Separation of user and system variables.
* minimizable variable groups.
* Debug table now updates on code compilation.
* Recursion limit for user variables. ( was possible to crash by having a reference in a table to itself for example)
* Added filter search box.
* Some minor margin adjustments to the debugger list.

Bug fix:
Formula ( and formula display ) stopped working if any parameters where updated while debugger was open.

Closes #7986 and #7955

* some mac complaint fixes

* some more tweaks
