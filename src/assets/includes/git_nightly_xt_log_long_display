Correct WT and Window handling og 16 full range wt files (#7703)

wt files with full-range 16 bit ints (so 16-is-16 or flag
0x8 + 0x4 = 0xC) was broken in a couple of ways, but most
importnatly, didn't survive a save/restore roundtrip.

This fixes it in three ways

1. When converting 16-as-16 to float scale accordingly with
   a different function and leave the ints untouched
2. Modify the window oscillator so if it gets a 16-as-16 it
   reduces the height of the ints to be consistent with a
   15 with an extra shift, making I15 WT vs Window and
   I16 WT vs Window consistent
3. Make sure it streams properly. No change required but
   tested.
