userDataPathValid, and response thereto (#7555)

userDataPathvalid is a new bool on storage. We read it to
at least block some obvious not-working things in the UI
crudely.

Could be better, but a better solution for these suers is to
get a writable documents directory! This is just avoiding crashes.
