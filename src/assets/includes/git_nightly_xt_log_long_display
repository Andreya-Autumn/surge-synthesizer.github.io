Slider-Mouse-Unhide error; Flanger temposync fix (#7234)

The horitonzal slider positioned the mouse subtly
incorrectly when it unhid, placing it at the top of the
slider box, which in the tightly packed FX section meant mis-clicks
were easy. Closes #7232

Also the temposycn scale on teh flanger rate was wrong, but
fix it using the API I just added to do same in Phaser.
Closes #7233
