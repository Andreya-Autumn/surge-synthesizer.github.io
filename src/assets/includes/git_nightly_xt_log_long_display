Osc work: fix to /wavetable query of never-a-wavetable oscillator (#7606)

* Adding /wavetable support to OSC

* Cleaning out some merge gark that snuck in

* one more cleanup

* /wavetable OSC functionality now includes /id, /incr, and /decr input messages for changing wavetable on a given scene/osc. Querying of current wavetable also supported.

* Refactored some confusing variable naming that reflected old structure to something much simpler and more logical.

* Updated OSC specification

* Caught two place where changing wavetables were not getting echoed to OSC (loading by filename and accessible "increment").

* Spec tweaks

* Another spec. tweak

* Made /q/wavetable output consistent with input (added '/index' to reported address)

* Spec update for /q/wavetable change

* spec tweak

* Refactored getCurrentWavetableName() from OscillatorWaveformDisplay into SurgeStorage, and used it for OSC output of wavetable name.

* clang-format
