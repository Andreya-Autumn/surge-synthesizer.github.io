Add reconstruction filter to the output of Ensemble effect (#7585)

* Add reconstruction filter to the output of Ensemble effect
* Update Ensemble init preset
* Fix handling streaming mismatches when loading FX presets being clobbered by parameter setting loop that was happening afterwards - instead handle mismatches after the setter loop does its thing
