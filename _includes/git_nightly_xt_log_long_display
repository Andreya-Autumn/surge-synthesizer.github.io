Save and restore oscilloscope parameter state to the DAW state (#6899)

* Create and populate a default oscilloscope overlay state.

Integrate the state into newly-constructed parameter classes.

* Save and restore scope DAW state to XML.

* Save new parameter values immediately, instead of in the destructor.

The XML is written out before the destructors run in the event that
Surge is closed when the overlay is still open.

* Add a new MultiSwitch method for setting the value from an integer.

* Fix the corner case of the trigger type.

It requires a hook to be called, and can't be set up directly from the
integer value due to how MultiSwitches work.

* Apply clang-format.
