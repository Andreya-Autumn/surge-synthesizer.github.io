Extend COMB size by 2x; Make extension cmake option (#7176)

1. The comb size is 2x larger allowing lower resonant
   physical modelling with the comb
2. Since this uses more memory, allow a build time flag
   to turn it off.  -DSST_FILTERS_COMB_EXTENSION_FACTOR=1
   will revert to 1.2; =4 will give you even more modelling.
   =3 will crash and burn horribly. Pick a power of 2 if you
   use this!

Closes #7172
