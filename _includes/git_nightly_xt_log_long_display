Fix a bug with Async Prompts (#5049)

the Async Prompt stuff earlier htis week to get MODAL_LOOPS
on broke the non-modal Storage OkCancel. Defacto this meant
that you could never replace a patch because the OK Cancel asked you
but had already canceled.

Closes #5045, where we had thought this was a global volume saving
problem, but it was really an anything saving problem
