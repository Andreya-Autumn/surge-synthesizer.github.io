Default tearouts to pinned in plugins; separate pref (#6821)

This defaults tearout windows to pin on top in plugin contexts
which solves problems in reaper, logic, live and more. To avoid
confusion with the standalone we also separate the user default
parameters by plugin and standalone, making this a really big diff
for a very small change (basically changing the default of alwaysOnTop
in a plugin only)

Closes #6633
