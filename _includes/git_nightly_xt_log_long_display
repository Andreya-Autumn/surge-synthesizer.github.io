Send Automation events Always (#6341)

A particular subset of discrete params would end up not generating
automation events - sort of a hodge podge. This is older code but
we should still send the event.

Without this change things like envelope type (digital/analog) didnt
toggle values in the bitwig param browser and weren't clickable in
cubase 12.

Closes #6284
