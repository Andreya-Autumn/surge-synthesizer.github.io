Re-work the ALternates system; combine with Indices (#4878)

Closes #2678
Closes #4868

Rework the alternates system and merge it with indexed modulators

1. A rational data structure for the grid layout, including an
   alternates stack at each grid point.
2. The UI widget now has a vector of possibilities
3. If that vector size > 1 it shows a burger and lets you swap
4. Which updates hte internal state of the SGE properly
