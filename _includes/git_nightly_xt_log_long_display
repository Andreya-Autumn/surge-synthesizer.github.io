Allow scene modulators onto globals correctly (#4960)

As detained in #2285, scene b modulators onto global properties
(basically FX) didn't work but kinda looked like it kinda worked
so add a scene_source which is (1) only used for global targets and
(2) always set to 0 for everything which isn't an LFO

Closes #2285
