Adjust height of Alias additive editor (#6247)

* Adjust height of Alias additive editor

...because it looked bad in Royal Surge skin. Plus now it has the same height as waveform display, so switching between the two modes looks nice, actually.

Also addressed #6244 by fixing some cases of Shift+F10 not working, and adding the required method elsewhere (but for some reason it's not working in those other cases)

Fix missing break before PREV_PATCH keybind case

Reorder menu options for extra a11y announcements and kbd vs mouse focus for Shift+F10 and Alt+V keybinds

Adjust wording for Confirm Patch/Category Change prompts so that they don't mention specific keybinds
