A few more minor UI tweaks (#5287)

Refresh LFO type asset (00166) for both skins (square waveform was looking wrong,
hoverOn state for Formula had too thick of a stroke)
Bold Surge XT title in SA titlebar (to match bold text in overlay titlebars)
Add font style to getFiraMonoAtSize() and use it for SA titlebar
