Move towards editor undo (#6004)

This is a basic infrastucture which moves us towards undo
in an editor. Lots missing here all detailed in a checklist
in #694 but with this commit parameter changes, modulation changes,
osc and fx changes all push into the undo stack. Use a simple limit
of 250 gestures per instance captured.
