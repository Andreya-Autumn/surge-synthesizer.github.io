Remove prior skin components on skin swap (#4850)

Prior skin components were removed from frame but
a refernece to their pointer was still around. When
we swap skins, clean them up. (They didn't leak per
se since they went away at shutdown but they were unused
and unallocated at runtime before this)

Closes #4588
