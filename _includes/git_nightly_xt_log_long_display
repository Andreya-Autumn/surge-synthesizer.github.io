Handle F2 Offset Scene Copy and Paste Error (#6487)

F2 offset copied properly but didn't update the params correctly
so the slider had the wrong type. This is done as one of several
things and we need to review them, as discussed in #6486 but
until then, lets just do the gross thing to address this one case.

Closes #6475
