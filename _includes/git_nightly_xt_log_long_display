More progress on KeyBinding manager (#6087)

1. Accessible buttons to learn, reset, etc...
2. Remember defaults so we can reset
3. Ability to learn
4. Some edge case bugs fixed

Addresses #5914

I think the thing to close that issue now is: what do we wnat this
screen to look like and how does that interact with the accssible view
