Start work on Input with non-block-size blocks (#6880)

Input with block-size-not-multiple-of-BLOCK_SIZE blocks would
distort in all platforms. This begins to fix it for the VST3 and AU
with the VST3 being most important, since FL does this all the time.

What we do here is: if a block is handed to us with a non-multiple
of BLOCK_SIZE we just start lagging the input. We don't turn on
latent processing in the synth, we don't do it in the CLAP, and we
don't show a user error. Clearly this requires more thought but it
will stop randomly distorted and crashing behavior, at least, in
the case where you don't have uniform blocks.
