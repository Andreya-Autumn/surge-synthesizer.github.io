Apply modulation before LFO attack (limited) (#5878)

Some modulations at the voice level were applied to the local
copy used by the voice LFO before the attack began. This meant,
basically, that modulating LFO amplitude with velocity didn't quite
work.

So change the structure of SurgeVoice to have an applyModulationToLocalcopy
method which either can or cannot skip LFO sources (since it can't apply
the local sources pre-attack) and then call that before the attakc in
voice initiation, and again after attack to finish the matrix (via
calc_ctrldata)

Closes #5872
