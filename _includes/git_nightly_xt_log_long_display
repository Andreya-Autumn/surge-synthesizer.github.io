Take Tuning Screens Live (#5210)

Still a lot of work to do but with this commit

1. The SCL/KBM text area has an apply button which works
2. The Radial Graph actually retunes
3. And it's all hoooked up

So getting really close here now that this works. Just a few
more screens and some colors.
