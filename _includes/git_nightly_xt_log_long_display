Start on typeahead-stay-open for Patches (#6097)

1. Add a dismiss mode to the TypeAhead widget
2. Set ti to DISMISS_ON_RETURN_RETAIN_ON_CMD_RETURN in patch selector
3. Adjust so that that does roughly what you would want, at least
   roughly
4. Merge for feedback on the edge cases, of which I bet there are
   many
