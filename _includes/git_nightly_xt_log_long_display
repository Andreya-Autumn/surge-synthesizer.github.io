Fixes for LuaJit in Standalone on 10.14 (#6542)

The LuaJit in 10.14 ran into signing problems either because
it wasn't forced to non-debug symbols or because it had
incorrect hardened permissions. This fixes the problem
at the slight cost of having a relatively high hardening
exception.

Closes #6420
