Protect against other NaNs in MSEG (#7182)

The broken preset in #6918 had got a nan in it. We've since fixed
a bunch of ways to make nans accidentally in the editor but in case
we don't get them all, and since this is ui thread stuff, just always
constrain mseg values to std::isfinite

Closes #6918
