Towards a Variable Block Size (#6584)

1. Makes the BLOCK_SIZE something you can set form CMake at compile time
2. Fixes the associated half rate filter problems
3. Confirms oscillators, filters, waveshapers, FM work
4. Fixes the copy_block error which resulted in Combulator, Resonator,
   RingModulate nd Waveshaper effect
5. Fix Delay and Distortion due to mis-coded basic_dsp for small blocks
6. More basic_dsp fixes for small blocks
7. Nimbus doesn't work in block size 8; merge and fix separately
