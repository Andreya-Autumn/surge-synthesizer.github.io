Renamed pretty much all OSC param names (#6980)

* Renamed pretty much all OSC param names
Sideeffect: Renamed Level parameter in mixer to Volume to be consistent with scene output and global volume params.

Also removed setOSCName() method and hasOSCName member, as a consequence. The way things are implemented here completely obsoleted this method.
