Merge in S(m)exoscope (#6704)

* Fairly straightforward import of the smexoscope waveform display.
* Add a version of ModulatableSlider that self-draws and notifies on changes.
* Add parameters at the bottom of the scope for the spectrogram and waveform.
* Add a self-listening self-drawing MultiSwitch.
