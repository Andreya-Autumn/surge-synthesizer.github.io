Refactor accessibility name setting (#4802)

1. Put it in one spot so we don't have to litter all of
   SGE with #if SURGE_JUCE_ACESSIBLE
2. if mac it to handle a discrepancy between description/title
   on mac vs win
3. Add "Scene" to the accessible parameter name (so rather than
   "A FX1 Cutoff" it is "Scene A FX1 Cutoff" to disambiguate
   from the english language pronoun in the sentence "Adjust A
   FEG Attack"
