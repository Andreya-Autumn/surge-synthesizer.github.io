Change a few patch db things (#4824)

1. Don't initialize the DB on startup; rather init it when
   you first open the patch browser
2. End my 'throw in destructor' bad habit since that worked
   horribly. Catch everything properly etc...

This closes #4822 but there's still lots to do in #2359 including
a nasty locked handler fail when you start two surges against a fresh
db
