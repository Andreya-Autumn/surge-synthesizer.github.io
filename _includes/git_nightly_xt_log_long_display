Fix a collection of scene mod small problems (#5207)

There were a collection of problems in the new UI along with
the cross-scene stuff mostly involving mistakes around whether
a modulator was cross-scene or not. So

1. Make sure to always assigne macros and other non-split sources
   from an artificial scene 0
2. When iterating to show menus and clear, make sure you show
   all the targets for non-split sources
3. Read appropriate scene split state when activating items,
   which means an SLFO -> global in scene A didn't stay 'lit' in
   scene b
