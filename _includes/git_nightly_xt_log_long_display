Moveable Overlays (#5230)

Some overlays are movable. Following the spec in #2824 they save
their last moved state into prefs when dragged. Also double click
returns them to default location when done in header. It's pretty
nifty actually! Tuning, ModList, MSEG/Form and WS Analysis all
got the treatment

Closes #2824
