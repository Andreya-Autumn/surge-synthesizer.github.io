More Accesibility Fixes (#6172)

Addresses #5714

- Home/End on modlist go to right value. (Really Slider was sending
  wrong value in 'value' mode for min, but that was clamped elsewhere
  in every case *except* the mod list)
- Update mod keys by same amount as mouse
- Menu to a slider for better VO announcement
- Proceted a pointer on patch selector tooltip
- Swap shift/control for step seq key bindings
- Announce FX Presets
- Announce Wavetables
- Enter works on wavetable jog
