Drop JuceHeader.h, include JUCE modules directly (#4816)

JuceHeader.h is a generated header that includes all enabled JUCE
modules. This was bloating the preprocessed sources of many Surge TUs by
hundreds of KBytes each (on Linux), slowing down the build somewhat.

Also, JuceHeader.h is generated at build time, impairing IDE navigation
and completion until halfway through an initial build.

This change includes only the required JUCE modules directly, which
is supported in CMake projects as per the documentation.
