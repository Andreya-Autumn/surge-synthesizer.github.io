Change the Audio Input Latency error (#6998)

The Audio input latency message shipped with Surge 1.2.0 fired
way too often to be useful to users, especially users who never
use the feature. This retains the behavior (uneven blocks are latent
and complete) but instead marks it on the input of audio in when
latent.
