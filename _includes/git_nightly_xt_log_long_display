Fix a number of step seq UI/UX regressions (#4924)

Addresses #4877

Also:
- properly update state of Pencil button when toggling
  MSEG/formula overlays by clicking on the display
- rename msegEditSwitch SGE member to something more universal
- make elementary rects of LFO widget member variables,
  remove &within argument from pain functions as a consequence
- step seq value is added directly on mouse down, not just on mouse move
