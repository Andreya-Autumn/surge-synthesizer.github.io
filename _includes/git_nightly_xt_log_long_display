Allow a SURGE build without any libMTS (#6725)

Adding the cmake option -DSURGE_SKIP_ODDSOUND_MTS=TRUE means that
surge will not consume an libMTS code and will not present users
the MTS options. The default build settings include MTS so if you
want an MTS free surge, you need to actively set the option.
