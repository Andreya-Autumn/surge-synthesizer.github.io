Add more keyboard shortcuts, some code refactoring (#5110)

Tagging @VincyZed here because documentation.

Alt+1/2/3 - select oscillator
Alt+S - switch scenes
Alt+M - toggle Modulation List
Alt+T - toggle Tuning Editor
Alt+E - toggle whichever editor is viable to toggle (for now MSEG and Formula only)
Alt+P - toggle Patch Browser (well it's called Database currently)
Ctrl+left/right - previous/next patch
Shift+left/right - previous/next category
Ctrl+S - store patch but currently not working (needs investigation)

This PR also refactors some code into methods (changeSelectedOsc(), changeSelectedScene(), refreshSkin()).
Keyboard shortcuts are separately togglable for standalone (default enabled) and plugin (defualt disabled).
Removed the last remnants of PORTED_TO_JUCE from VSTGUI times.
Updated the Workflow menu layout, added some separators.
Removed SkinReloadViaF5 user default.
If a default is not recognized, instead of popping up an error dialog for each one, silently disregard them.
