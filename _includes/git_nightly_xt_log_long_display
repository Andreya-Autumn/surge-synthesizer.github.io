Adjust Freerun LFO Attack (#6151)

Freerun LFO Attack would occur whenver a key was pressed from
0 to one keys. This had the ugly result that the SNH and Noise
modulators were incorrect. We want the envelope to re-attack
when that occurs but not ht einternal state, so compensate
the internal state appropriately.
