Act as ODDSound MTS Main ('Master') (#6771)

This allows you to have a single surge instance act as an
oddsound MTS-ESP Master (which we call Main) component.
In this mode, the tunign editor features stay active but
are broadcast to all other MTS-ESP clients on your system
if the master is initializable.
