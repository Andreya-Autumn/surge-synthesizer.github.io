Doubleclick Renamed Modulators without annoying bug (#6024)

Doubleclick renames a modulator. Cool

But this kinda sucks if you click into a modulator and then click to arm
quickly and misfire a double click

So if you have *just* selected a modulator the double click doesn't work.

Only after that

Closes #5774
