Handle latch in dual MPE and no-23 mode (#7126)

In MPE or ignore-23-to-scene mode, turning one scene
on to latch would mistakenly trigger voices in the non
latched scene. Fix that but adding an intended scene optional
argument to playNote and calling it from the right place. Also
add a regtest.

Closes #6963
