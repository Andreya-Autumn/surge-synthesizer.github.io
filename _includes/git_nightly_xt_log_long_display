Add some prompts for accesible startup and destructive actions (#5750)

1. If you press an accessible key and keyboard mapping isn't
   on, ask. Improves #4616
2. If you press shift/lr for patch and cmd/lr for category
   prompt before blowing away your patch
3. In both cases, have a 'sticky' option to remember your
   choice, and add that as a generic capability
