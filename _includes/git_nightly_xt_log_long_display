Add an option to explod Mod Workflow menus (#6393)

The modulation menu (edit/clear/mute) is very clumsy in screen
readers. So add a workflow option to keep the menu unchanged but
also adds a screen-reader friendly sub-menu with the edit/mute/clear
option. This will almost definitely only be used by screen reader users.
