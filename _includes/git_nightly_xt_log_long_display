Fix a Pedal Polymode problem (#5651)

In poly mode

pedal down
note 60 on
note 60 off
note 60 on
pedal release

would result in 2 voices playing not one. While this is not
wrong per-se, its not how other instruments (like pianos)
woudl work and it's not how most other synths work, so choose
the convention that we switch to 1 note playing for XT
