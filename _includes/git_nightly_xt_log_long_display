Initial version of category typeahead (#5185)

The primary thing this accomplishes is give us a typeahead
widget, which still needs work for skinning, font, etc...
but which takes a data provider and does reductive typeahead
with mouse gestures to select.

I used it in the user category list in the Patch Selector for now
