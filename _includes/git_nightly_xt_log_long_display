Remediate the localcopy surgevoice errors (#6537)

* Remediate the localcopy surgevoice errors

I don't know why this didn't work, but it didn't. Use the
scene direct rather than localcopy values for filters and
the like to avoid pops and clicks when changing filters

Closes #6489

* Also fix the unison oscillator problem and LFO shape problem
which was similarly misguided, which Closes #6531
