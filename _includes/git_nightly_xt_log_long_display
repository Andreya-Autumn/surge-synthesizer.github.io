A set of minor UI tweaks (#5356)

Mod list now uses slider modulation pos/neg colors for the mod amount range section
Capitalization tweaks in a few places
Some context menu shuffling (order of sections in modbuttons)
Rename parameter FX Bypass to FX Chain Bypass (because that's what it really is)
