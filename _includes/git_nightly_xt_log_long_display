Reduce allocation on audio thread (#4839)

1. Make string and twist "small" with alloc in ctor/dtor for now
2. Once they are small, move spawn_osc to take an external buffer
   and new onto that
3. And then manage those buffers as a member of voice or as memory
   handed in from some other mechanism

Addresses #805

To be done with #805 I need to deal with those String and Twsti allocations
although I may open that as two separate issues.
