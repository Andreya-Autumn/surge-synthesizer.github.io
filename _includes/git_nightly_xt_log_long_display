Be a bit more careful about a patch load race (#6167)

In #6140 we had reports of logic sometimes resetting to default
rather than loading the stored patch. I could occasionally reproduce
this and I think it is a race condition between unstream state and
processing starting and the patchid_queue being set. So when
you unstream state, reset the patch id queue completely to make sure
nothing loads after you.

Addresses #6140. Will revert to users for testing before closing.
