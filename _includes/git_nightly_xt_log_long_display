Few more changes to bypass (#6025)

1. If you hard-off the synth (so don't bypass just stop calling
   process) when you come back, note off
2. Have a bypass parameter rather than processBypass
3. Based on that bypass parameter, do a smooth note off
4. bypass parameter advertises as non-automatable, hopefully
   to work around that FL bug.
5. Remove some misleading comments
