Set SandboxTrue in the Audio Unit (#5641)

This change sets sandboxEnabled true in the AU plist, allowing
loading into mac app store.

This requires a merge and full cycle to test alas, so I may revert
it, but before merging I made sure that

1. I could still sign the AU
2. The AU still loaded in Reaper and Logic

So lets see if this helps the fine folks over at #5633
