Osc noteid fix (#7122)

* Made it possible to pass noteIDs via OSC. For /fnote; when no noteID is passed, one is now calculated from frequency with better precision. Added array size checking for all OSC In messages.

* Error msg tweak

* Fixed user-supplied noteIDs

* Updated OSC spec doc for notes.

* OSC spec HTML cleanup

* one last HTML tweak

* Added range checking to user-supplied OSC noteIDs
