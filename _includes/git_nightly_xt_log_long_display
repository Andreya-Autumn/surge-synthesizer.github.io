Velocity 0 == note off; CLAP features (#6624)

1. Velocity 0 == Note Off was not working in the CLAP_NOTE_EVENT
   stream. Correct and defensively correct in the juce stream also
   (although I think juce will have pre-converted for me)
2. Add "synthesizer" as a CLAP feature to surge xt, since surge xt
   is, in fact, a synthesizer :)

Closes #6621
