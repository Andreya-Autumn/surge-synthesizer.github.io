Stolen voice velocity is not release velocity (#6508)

In mono modes the restarted stolen voice in non-ST mono
modes which was triggered in releaseNote used the release
velocity, which is mostly nonsensical. Replace it with the
velocity of the note we just terminated which is at least
sensible

Closes #6504
