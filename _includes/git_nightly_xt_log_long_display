Memory Reuse for allocating oscillators: String (#5264)

This commit gives an API which allows us to reuse rather
than reallocate the memory buffers that objects need
at play time. Right now it only deals with the string
oscillator and still does 'extra' allocation on the audio
thread, but has a reasonable pre-allocate and re-use
strategy. In the future the overflow allocs could be
off thread but for now it's a simple save and reuse
approach.

Thanks to Luna for a review, and also glad I added
that test!

Closes #4840
