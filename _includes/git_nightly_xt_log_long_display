Add a Normal distribution to each Random (#4872)

The Random Bi and Uni polar have a normally distributed output
as well as a uniform one, implemented as modulator indices.
This is useful, but also serves as a 'second implementation'
test of my modulator index code and as such has a couple of
tiny tweaks and fixes from adding a second, addresseing #4868
