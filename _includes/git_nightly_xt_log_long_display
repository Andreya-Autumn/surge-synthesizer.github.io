A test showing cross-channel ST stuck notes (#6492)

* A test showing cross-channel ST stuck notes

If you do note on/off across channels in SingleTrigger mode
you end up with a stuck voice. This is almost definitely the
channel mask not getting updated, but that's a tricky change
so for now just add the test with the failing condition knocked
out and a comment pointing at #6287
