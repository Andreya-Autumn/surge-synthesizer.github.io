Minor patch store dialog tweaks and tiny other stuff (#5224)

* Minor patch store dialog tweaks and tiny other stuff

* Name field gets text focus when patch store dialog gets focus
* Name, Author and Category fields get select all when focused
* Positioning and sizing of OK/Cancel/Factory Overwrite buttons
* TODO: Patch Store dialog doesn't get keyboard focus on instantiation (attempt is in ctor)

* Rename folders Jacky Ligon/Bass to JL/Basses and Kyurumi/Rhythmic to Kyurumi/Rhythms

* Patch search typeahead positioning tweak so that it matches regular patch name font
(but it doesn't work the very first time you activate it - works for every subsequent toggle!)

* Forgot to remove one comment
