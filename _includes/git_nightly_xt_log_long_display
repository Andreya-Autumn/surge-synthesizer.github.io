Correct AW Lifecycle; Restore AD-Clip (#6548)

The fix in 91bc21cb75 was not quite correct. The actual problem was
that the the local ivalues were updated at the wrong point in the cycle
for the re-start effect hence the 'phantom 0' in the pdata_ival
but that phantom 0 is not in fxdata, which is correct, so adjust the
code, preservbing the fix from the prior commit but also restoring
the functionality of AD-Clip, aka AirWin ID 0

Closes #6479
