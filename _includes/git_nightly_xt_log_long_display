MSEG ControlPOint would nan with identical VValues (#7180)

For some types where we scale the change in cpv by the
values (like linear), a pair of identical points would
nan out the CPV

Embassingly this mean tthe default mseg / grab sustain CPV / drag
would destroy our mseg.

Addresses #6918 but its not the core problem there
