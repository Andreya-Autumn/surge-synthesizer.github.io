Use the defaulted copy and assignment constructors, instead of memcpy… (#6732)

* Use the defaulted copy and assignment constructors, instead of memcpy, for parameters in SurgeSynthesizer.

Starting with just this file, rather than a full replacement, to ensure that
everything is good with the outcome here before I change everything else.

* Fix clang-format.

* Remove superfluous memcpy, it breaks copy/assignment containing arrays.

* More Parameter-related memcpy removals.
