Start to do Accessible Edit Cleanup (#5647)

This is the first of several commits to incorporate
feedback from the accessibile testers. It primarily does
the following

1: Centralize accessible keybindings in one place
2: Respond to Shift-F10 for menu on the activated components
3: General code cleanup and stuff as I get ready to do the harder items.
