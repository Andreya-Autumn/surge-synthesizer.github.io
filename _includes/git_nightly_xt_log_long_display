Various parameter and naming adjustments for Bonsai (#7045)

Bass Distort is now in 0-100%
Bias Filter modes now don't mention "type x"
Dist Mode is now called Type with nice user-friendly names
Noise Gain is not asymmeteric nor extendable anymore
Input and output gain are both just named Gain to comply to other Surge effects
Removed two custom ctypes and replaced them with existing ones instead
Moved Bonsai to the first place in the Distortion effect group in the menu
