Make surgepy an installable Python package (#6790)

Use scikit-build, a tool for packaging Python extensions built with CMake,
to make surgepy an installable Python package.

Surgepy can now be built and installed by running

    > python3 -m pip install <REPO_DIR>/src/surge-python

where <REPO_DIR> is the surge repo.

This allows, for example, installing surgepy in a Python virtual
environment for development.

The ordinary (non scikit-build) CMake build for surgepy is unchanged.
