Use OS DarkMode from sst; Use strnatcmp from sst (#5887)

sst_plugininfra provides an isDarkMode API (currently only
returning correct values on macOS). This diff does the following

1. Move the menu colors to either follow OS or follow skin
2. Since that involves an upgrade to sstplugininfra, also fix
the strnatcmp dependency, addressing #5868
