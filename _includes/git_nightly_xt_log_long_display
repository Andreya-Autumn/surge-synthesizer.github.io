Correct a Numbus Indexing Error which could impact Delays (#6095)

Nimbus had an indexing error which made the looping delay in some
cases catastrophically bitcrush. While cleaning it up I realized
I just wanted to go to fixed nimbus blocks anyway since the compelxity
which led to that bug came from the offsets and so on.

Anyway this removes some mis-renderes in Nimbus both in the synth
and especially the fX plugin

Closes #5954
