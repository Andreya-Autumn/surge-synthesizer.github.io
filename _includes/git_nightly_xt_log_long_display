Expand FX Slots - Step 1 (#4859)

This commit begins the path laid out in #2446 to expand the number
of FX slots, and gets a long way there. It does the following

1. Expand the slots and adjust all the internal data structures
   and streamers properly
2. Update the UI to allow the slots to be addressed and edited
3. Implement the A B and Main new inserts
4. Position but don't allow sends to Send 3 and 4
5. Disable the old pre-juce test for stable IDs which no longer
   either applies or passes

To complete #2446 we need to allow send 3 and 4 to be addressible
and that's the last bit of work, basically adding new send level
parameters and associated sliders which we hide and show.
