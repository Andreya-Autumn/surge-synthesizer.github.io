Modulation: Keybind to Arm and Restore Middle Mouse (#6550)

* Modulation: Keybind to Arm and Restore Middle Mouse

1. Keybind Alt/Opt+A toggles modulation
2. The middle mouse button forward-to-main-frame wasn't in
   ModulationSourceButton so that command selected and armed
   which wasn't desired.

Closes #6549
