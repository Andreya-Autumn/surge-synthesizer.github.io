Four tab-order fixes (#5733)

1: The MultiSwitch with rows=cols=1 would null out the children
   and confuse the tab order, basically making menu not tab order
   visible (and save!)
2: The tab didn't "loop" properly and dealt poorly with hitting
   null components; fix that
3: Make the frames focus containers but not keyboard focus containers
   to skip an ordering in the tab heirarchy
4: Make the main menu the 'first' item in tab order
