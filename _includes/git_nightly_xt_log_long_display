Some small PatchDb Improvements (#5098)

1. Improve concurrency both in and cross process
   a. open one connection per thread
   b. close the readwrite connection when not in use
   c. since (a) we can do nomutex and therefore
   d. since (c) and (b) not lock across processes
2. Add a 'debug junk' table and a 'debug' button to write into it
   to test for now
