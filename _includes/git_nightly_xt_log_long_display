WaveShaper Flex Continues (#4984)

1. A new waveshaper 'soft fold' (x / (0.7 + 0.4 x^2). Thanks to
   @SignalSmith on audio programmer discord for pointihing this shape
   out to me

2. An FX selection for the rotary and distortion driven by
   configuration, with a subset of the new shapers in place
