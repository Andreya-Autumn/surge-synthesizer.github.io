Disable presets-to-host mechanism for now (#4760)

There was a built in preset index error which forced
Reaper (and perhaps other hosts) to force-override the song
state in some cases. Even when fixed, though, logic clobbers
if you have selected. Need to figure this out later so just
turn it all off for now.
