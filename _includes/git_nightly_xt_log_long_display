Osc freqnote (#7118)

* OSC 'freqnote' support, in progress.

* Guardrails on /fnote frequency, so that it doesn't overflow MIDI note value. Updated OSC Spec webpage

* Added OSC error messages.

* All OSC 'note' behavior implemented.

* Don't need a return from playNoteByFrequency.

* Removed redundant globals. Sent OSC error output to cout if OSC out is switched off.

* Changed a float_32t to a regular float.

* Fixed MAX_MIDI_FREQ.

* Another fix to the MAX_MIDI_FREQ constant
