String Oscillator Alloc Tweak (#6710)

The string oscillator assumed that `init` was only called
once per instance, so checked out a delay line from the pre-allocated
pool in init. But if init was called twoce it would check out again
but not return first.

In surge proper this doesn't matter since we in-place new a new
instance for each voice on. but in rack where we make external
retriggers available it did; this manifested itself as a string
oscillator leak in rack

The delay lines are pre-initialized to null so simply check if they are
null before accessing from the memory pool and this fixes the rack leak
