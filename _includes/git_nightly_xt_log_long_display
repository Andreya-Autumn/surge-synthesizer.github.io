Add a defensive clamp to airwindows name lookup (#6878)

I think theres a tiny race condition which means a parameter can
have an airwindows paramter mapper on a non-airwindows parameter
when changing presets while notes are playing, as described in
proper rebuild, so XT2, but for now add a bit of defense on range
vs the static data structure.
