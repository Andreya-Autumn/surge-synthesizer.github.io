An expanded menu (part 1) for modulation (#5063)

This creates an expanded menu which has an X Mute and Edit icon
rather than the word "Edit" collapsing the "Edit/Clear" and adding
a "Mute", but currently only does it on target (slider) modulators
not source (LFO, Macro) modulators while we get feedback.
