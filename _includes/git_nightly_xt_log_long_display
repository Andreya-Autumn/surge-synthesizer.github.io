Dont allow double-source registry in MTS (#6791)

Don't allow *any* of the MTS source paths to double register a
master. Previously we supressed the 'becone source' menu if
can register was false, but unstreaming didn't do the check.
Now it will and will pop an error if you try a registration
when you can't.
