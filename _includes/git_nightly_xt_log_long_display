Add an errorType enum; use it to report latency shift. (#6881)


1. Add a SurgeStorage::ErrorType enum which goes with reportError
   and defaults to GENERAL_ERROR
2. Call reportError with AUDIO_CONFIGURATION from the new resize
3. When we get that in SurgeGUIEditor, do nothing. Oh well! Maybe
   later we will do something.
