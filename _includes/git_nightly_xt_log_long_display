macOS: Switch to C++17 (like the other platforms) (#5124)

Library support is spotty on our current deployment target 10.11 "El
Capitan", but a consistent language level across platforms does make
life easier for devs, especially those who aren't on Mac. C++17 also
fixes under-aligned allocations on ARM Macs, potentially improving
performance.

To keep us pre-Mojave compatible, this implements aligned operators
new/delete in a new library "surge-platform" that will also become home
for other platform-specific code currently lurking between #ifdefs.
