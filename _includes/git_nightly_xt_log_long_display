Add HP for S channel to Conditioner (#5195)

- A deactivatable Highpass Filter for the Side Channel in Conditioner
  (named "Side Low Cut" for consistency)
  to roll off low frequencies in the stereo width.
- set threshold to-6dB in init preset to avoid level jump

This was a test in preparation for the ms tool.
I thought I'd ask before I throw it away...
It is patch compatible with 1.9
(but not compatible with old user-fx-presets)
