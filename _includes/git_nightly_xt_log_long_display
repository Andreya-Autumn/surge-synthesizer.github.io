Further infrastructural PatchBrowser work (#4796)

This commit hints at some of the features of the patch
browser, and undertakes a lot of infrastructural improvements
which will allow them. It includes

1. Using the JUCE treeview to show some navigation, even though
   it is not hooked up as a filter
2. Having categories in the database, although not normalized to
   patches by ID yet (soon)
3. Adding various convenience and encapsulation classes to the
   PatchDB internals, including small objects to make the
   sqlite3 API for sstatements cleaner and have better error
   checking
4. Modify my worker queue to be omre generic so we can load more
   than just patches

Still the patch browser isn't 'good' or 'complete' but I want
to do a checkpoint here and move onto my next steps.
