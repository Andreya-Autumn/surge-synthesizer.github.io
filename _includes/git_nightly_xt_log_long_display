Add LongPressMixin to other widgets (#5979)

Closes #5802 after tweaking it a little more - for some reason long press doesn't activate context menu for EffectChooser.

Also long press context menu is not implemented in OscillatorWaveformDisplay (Alias additive editor has a context menu which would be nice to open via touch too).
