FX Swap in Undo; Swap to Self crash resolved (#7086)

1. FX Swap didn't particpate in Undo. It does now (with a full patch
   stream which is the best we can do)

2. FX Swap when dropped on itself would swap with self, with sometimes
   catastrophic mistakes. Put a source==target guard in along with the
   other source and target range checks. Closes #7085
