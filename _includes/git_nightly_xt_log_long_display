MIDI Program Change Support (#7171)

Addresses #576

I might even go as so far as to say we are done with #576 with this
commit but I'm sure there will be comments and changes still. So here's
how it works

1. We add a new directory %USER%/Patches/MIDI Programs
2. We add a new data structure `patchIdToMidiBankAndProgram[128][128]` which
   for a bank and program is used for a patch id
3. We populate it as follows

   a. If `MIDI Programs` has top level patches those become bank 0
   b. If `MIDI Programs` has directories, those fill in order. So a
      just-directories MIDI programs has bank 0 as the first directory
      and a mix and match has bank 0 as the raw top level and bank 1
      as the first directory
   c. If there's still banks to be filled we fill them one at a time
      from factor. So if you have 6 directories in MIDI Programs,
      bank 7 will become 'Basses' (the first factory)

By 'fill' we mean traverse the category in alphabetical order and
set the patches as programs, up to 128

Banks with < 128 patches don't respond to PCH for the empty slots
Categories with > 128 patches only map the first 128
