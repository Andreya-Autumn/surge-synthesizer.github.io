FX Mode handles block mod buffers better (#6866)

In the event we are in non-latent mode and our buffer is
not a multiple of block size, then

1: reset the inputs and outputs
2: Enter latent mode
3: set latency and
4: inform the host of a latency change

Addresses #6638 but some testing before we close it would be
super.
