Accessibility Menu; Patch to Text (#6819)

A couple of accessibility features

1. Add an "Accessibility" menu
2. Add a "set to recommended accessibility settings" item to it that sets
   the four settings which folks recommend.
3. Add a very early draft of patch->text for sharing a description of the
   patch for feedback on if it is is even useful to consider developing
