Use full display name for FX menu in Surge FX (#5466)

Also rename fx_type_shortnames to fx_type_acronyms.
Previously fx_type_names are now fx_type_shortnames, and fx_type_names
contain full display names (as in preset XML).

Also the SXTFX GUI now also properly says Surge XT Effects (no more Surge FX Bank)

Also updated Adding an FX documentation with the new array names.
