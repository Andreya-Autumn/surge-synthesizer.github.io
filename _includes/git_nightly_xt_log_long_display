Fix Solo and Mute for held voices (#6459)

Much like the change for OSC Type in  d6a135a58682b5, Solo
and Mute deal poorly with reading the modulated vs scene
variables when running sustained voices, which is a regression
from 1.0.1 with no real benefti beyond external polymod. So make
these non polymod and return to direct access.
