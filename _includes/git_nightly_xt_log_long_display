Fix two annoying mac slider problems (#4962)

1. The hide happens on mouseDown. In 1.9 it happened on mouse
   drag and that is much more natural, especially with a double
   click gesture, so revert to 1.9 behavior
2. The 'distance' calculation was from mouseDownPosition which was
   an int but on high res mac displays at > 200% that int to float
   rounding meant you failed a drag at the outset, so keep your
   own mouseFloatPosition
