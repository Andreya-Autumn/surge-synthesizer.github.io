shared_ptr<float[N]> workaround (#7117)

C++17 allows a shared_ptr<float[N]> but earlier doesn't. Thats fine
we are C++17 but rack compiles with such an old version of the
OSX SDK that it doesn't have the appropriat econstructor in place.
We could do a bunch of ifdefs to fix this but instead, just make
the type shared_ptr<float> in this case and adjust the constructor
to have a custom [] deallocator.
