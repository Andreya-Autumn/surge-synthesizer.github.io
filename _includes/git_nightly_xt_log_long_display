Menu Bold Fonts use the Bold Typeface (#7093)

Bold fonts in menus used `getPopupMenuFont().bolden()` which in
some cases on macOS renders improperly for our TTF font but we
aren't sure why. We already ship the LatoBold font TTF with surge,
so instead add a `getPopupMenuFontBold` API point which uses that TTF
and adjust calling code to use that rather than font.bolden

My theory is this will address #7021 but lets leave it open until
we get confirmation from a user.
