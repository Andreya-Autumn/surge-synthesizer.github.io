Optional Arrow Keys for Slider/Button Editors (#5636)

As part of #4616, I learned that even though the accesibility
API has a well defined setvalue method which works, many accessible
users use arrow keys to adjust values. So this commit does three things

1. Makes widget focus follow tab order
2. Makes an optional arrow key to edit slider, button, number field, etc...
3. Make a system wide default for that which like the other kbd mods
   is off by default plugin and on standalone.

More to do here but I want to get this into the hands of the accesibility
testers so merging at this checkpoint.
