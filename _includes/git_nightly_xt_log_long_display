Display the OSC output *post* HalfRateFilter (#7158)

that HalfRateFilter covers a few sins that our averaging
technique didn't. With this change in place, the noisy
curves from the edges of extrreme feedback render just like
they do in a scop.

Remember to port this to rack also.

Closes #7154
