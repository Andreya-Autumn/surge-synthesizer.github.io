A large collection of Accessibility improvements (#5374)

This commit addresses many issues in #4616 with several changes

1. Rather than removing and adding all components on all rebuilds,
   track components which are changed between states of the UI.
   This results in much less parent hierarchy and accessibility churn
   and also means something like switching an oscillator type doesn't
   invalidate your acc tree

2. Make accessible hooks for LFO Shape and for the Effect Chooser

3. Clean up many mis-labeled or unlabeled components

4. Add a chunk of tests which exercise the accesibility api
   using atomacos to drive surge
