Traversal for Accessibility (#4803)

1. Add grouping layers to the main frame (which are invisible
   outside of the accesibility api)
2. Make sure almost everythig has a name (a few to go yet with
   filter selector and stuff)
3. Add a focus traversal order which is non random

Lets get feedback on this one
