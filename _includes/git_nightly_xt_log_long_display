Several UX tweaks (#6245)

1. Shortcut for Edit Parameter Value is Alt+V not Ctrl+V (Ctrl+V is commonly used for "paste")
2. Right click context menu that shows wavetable info and 2D/3D switch only shows for oscillators that use WT (it used to bleed through if you right click on Alias additive editor EDIT button)
