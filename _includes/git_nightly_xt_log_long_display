Update to C++20. (#7136)

* Update to C++20.
Turn off the breaking char8_t changes. Maybe they'll work in C++23.
* Make the no-char8_t bits C++-only.
* Update fmt to v9.
* Update sst-filters to HEAD.
* Remove bad template syntax that only worked before C++20.
* Fix implicit enum arithmetic that is deprecated in C++20.
* Fix implicit capture of this pointer, deprecated in C++20.
