Modulation Sliders and Arming via Screen Reader (#5559)

This commit adds three 'synthetic' accesible buttons to the
modlists, select, arm, and target (taregt == orange arrow)
and makes the modulatable slider setvalue api aware of if
the slider is armed for modulation.

This defacto makes modulation setup with screen readers
possible in sruge xt.
