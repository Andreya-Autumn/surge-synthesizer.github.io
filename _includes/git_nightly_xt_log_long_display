Clap note expression and port tweaks (#6215)

1. Support CLAP_NOTE_DIALECT_NOTE_CLAP properly through extensions
   upgrade
2. Handle polyphonic modulation without a note id since I say I can
   be addressed by channel
3. Make note_id = -1 the sentinel for absent note id as opposed to
   note_id > 0 the sentinel for present note id

Closes #6212
