Accessibility Work on the Weekend (#5945)

Addresses #5714

- Modulation Add/Filter buttons get enter and shift-f10 launching menu
- Tuning editor buttons (export etc) respond to return
- Debug-assert if key handler is silently dropped due to storage
- MSEG snap buttons respond to enter properly
- All other switches respond to enter properly
- Favorite add/remove announced to screen reader
- Announce init/step debugger stepping the debugger
- StepSequencer Changes
   - Steps then Trigmasks is tab order as opposed to step/trig
   - Rotate Buttons accessible
- Expanded names to ModList items (Depth -> "Depth Velcoity to A Osc1 Pitch")
- Add a few Notify calls (but doesn't fix the filter subtype)
- Change discrete menu type to ComboBox which is more accurate
  but still doesn't solve Twist not announcing on key change
