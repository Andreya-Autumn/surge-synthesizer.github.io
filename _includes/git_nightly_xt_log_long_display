Replace memcpy with std::copy and assignment operators where safe (#6738)

* Replace memcpy with std::copy and assignment operators where safe to do so.

This is all the memcpy that can reasonably be replaced without going through
and refactoring uses of C-style arrays and news into C++11-and-up constructs.
That seems like a reasonable exercise, but one for the future.
