UI Display of Wavetable Off by One Continuous (#6365)

So in continuous mode with wavetables your last frame is between
n-2 and n-1; but in discrete mode it is between n-1 and a coyp of n-1
so that there are effectively n tables. This allows in discrete mode each
modulation range to be conssitent. But means we need to get those
off-by-ones in there based on extend or not.

This is a UI only change. The wavetable and parameter value have always
been right; this is just the string and snap
