Modulator Menu and Name Changes (#5396)

1. For indexed modulators, the RMB menu shows
   jst the paths for that modulator.
2. LFO-class modulators can be renamed by index
   and then have short name of "N" and long name
   of "N (FORM 1.2)" or waht not. Closes #5391
3. Add a single api to get the name rather than
   having to add index extensions everywhere.
