Fix a problem with CLAP Modulator Stacking (#6259)

The CLAP spec states clearly that a polyphonic modulation event
*includes* any monophonic modulation events for a given parameter
so targeting a particular voice should use only the poly event
not the sum. Surge modulators are stacking, so take the easy approach
of back out any global mono modulators from poly modulators at modulation
time.
