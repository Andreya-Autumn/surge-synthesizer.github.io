Stop runaway modulators on extreme changes (#6863)

In extreme (really computer generated) midi sequences you could
force the modulator smoother to runaway since in one case it
would push you outside of [target,value] when interpolating.
Fix that with a clamp; and add an assert in case theres other
future problems.

Closes #6835
