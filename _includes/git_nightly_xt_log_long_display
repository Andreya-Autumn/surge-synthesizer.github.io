Handle Tuning Mode error when Togglign MTS (#5397)

When toggling MTS from a non-RETUNE_MIDI patch the synth
ended up in a mixed state of half-MTS half-native tuning.
So

1. Set the state to RETUNE MIDI if MTS is active
2. Keep the 'patch' state around so we can keep it saved for
   non mts applications

Addresses #5386 but there's more to do there - can I make the
filter tuning work with MTS is the open question left.
