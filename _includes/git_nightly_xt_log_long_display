Allow LFO Envelopes to retrigger from non-zero values (#6690)

This diff allows LFO envelopes to retrigger from non-zero values
when either attacking or just envelope retriggering. It compensates
for deform and envelope LFO cases also.

It defaults to being FROM_ZERO, the current surge behavior, and
does not activate the new behavior in surge VST. Surge XT Rack will
end up turning this on before the 1.0 release though.
