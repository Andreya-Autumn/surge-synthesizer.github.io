Reorder PatchDB operations on rename (#6975)

The patcdb rename would look like save / delete / update but
the save had a patch db update in it of course. So the delete
on unix would delete underneath the patch importer and the
importer is not robust under that condition (#6973). Fixing that
is hard, so rather than fix that today open an issue for it and
instead have the rename look like save+update / drain queue / delete+update
and then no more lock.

Closes #6959
