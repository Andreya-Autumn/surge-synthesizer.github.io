Several Threading Fixes (#6339)

1. The patchLoadThread should not be left active if the object
   is destroyed, so clean up / join in the destructor rather than
   just firing it detached

2. In the performUnsafeBlahDeBlah also load queued wavetables which
   will allow us to properly save if we have never run. Assert that
   we have built at least some wavetable before streaming it.
