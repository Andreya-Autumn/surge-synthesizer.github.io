Add a Formula Modulator Test Probe for UnitTests (#5327)

The unit tests couldn't really poke inside the modstate in running
surges. That's about to get important as I add the various
midi and velocity and other-modulator cases and I would prefer
to tackle that with unit tests. So add the plumbing I need
and a rudimentary regtest.
