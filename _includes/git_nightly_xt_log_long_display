Fix cross and MinGW builds, LuaJIT everywhere

Makes LuaJIT cross-capable and enables it unconditionally. Restores at
least these build targets (build-tested x86_64 hosts in parentheses):

- Linux/armv7l (Linux)
- MinGW-w64/x86_64 (Windows native, Linux, macOS)
- MinGW-w64/i686 (Windows native, Linux) - N/A on macOS, needs 32-bit
