Truncated WT Files no longer add noise (#6873)

Truncated WT files would silently fill the end of the buffer
with noise. This was actually a problem for oneshot/Pulse
which advertises 3 tables but has 2. Clearly some old
semantic where this would have worked is either ignore the
last or fill with zero, so replace the fixme which was sitting
here with a fill-with-zero. This will also fix
https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-rack/issues/843 when all
merged through.
