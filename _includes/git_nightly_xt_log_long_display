Mono-Legato Envelope mode (#6344)

Add a new mode for the AEG and FEG where in mono modes you
can retrigger the envelope start not from 0 / 0 phase / 0 charge
but from a phase / charge which matches the envelope levels of
the previously playing and stolen voice, if one is present (and
start from 0 otherwise).
