Title bar styling (#5117)

1. Override the titlebar
2. Demonstrate skin access in the look and feel points
3. Had it over to @mkruselj to make it look how he wants

Closes #5061

Leaves the standalone window border unadjusted (we need to change the color of the ultimate parent border, I suppose).
