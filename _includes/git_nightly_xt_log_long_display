Guard all our lambdas with SafePointers (#6560)

We had a bunch of lambdas which referenced 'this' rather than
'that = SafePointer' for callbacks on timers and I think
perhaps one of those is what caused the very occasional crash-on
close in reaper reported in #6421 so review them and push a change.

Keep the issue open for a bit while we look for crashes tho
