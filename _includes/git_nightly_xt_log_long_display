MIDI Controllers need SapmleRate for Smoothing (#6141)

Midi Controllers go through a ControllerModulationSource
for uniform smoothing. Those CMSs are the only ones created
outside the normal modluation path, so they didn't get a sapmle
rate set which, defacto, meant only immediate mode (namely
UI) edits worked but midi edits did not.

Closes #6139
