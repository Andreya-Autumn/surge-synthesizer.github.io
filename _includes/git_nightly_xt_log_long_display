Add a number of keybindings (#4932)

+ or - jog the zoom levels by 10%, Shift and +/- by 25%
* sets to default zoom level
Alt/Opt+K toggle virtual keyboard
Alt/Opt+D toggle the debug console
F1 opens manual
F5 refreshes skin (removed option to use it!)
F12 toggles About screen

Also:
Updated h.active to false on mouseUp in MSEGEditor (was annoying)
Made the virtual keyboard refresh octaves when changing Middle C
Adjusted the starting point of the virtual keyboard so that middle C is better centered
QWERTY will start playing from the middle octave, not the octave above
