Fix a Lanczos Resampler problem (#6742)

in https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/commit/66dde24b20c498335e57820088b4679c781fd7a1
I accidentally introduced a bug in the resampler used for twist
when having neagive offsets to supress a warning about
an unsigned compare incorrectly. Remediate.
