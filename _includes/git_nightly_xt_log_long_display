Deactivate misleading tuning typeins in Tune-After mode (#7178)

In Tune-After mode the typein "9/8" didn't uniformly give you
a 9/8 pitch shift; it gave you that many keys shift. This was
rather confusing. Some even called it "borked". So just make
a clear error that this typein style is only availabel in
tune-at-midi mode

Closes #6977
