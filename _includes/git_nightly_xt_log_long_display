Fix MSEG controls RMB menus not working, plus other minor stuff (#5734)

Also expand showMSEGPopupMenu() into covering both MSEG and Formula context menus.
Add context menu for Formula.
Show the keyboard shortcut for LFO editor overlays (Alt+E).
Make "Open Tuning Editor..." menu entry flip between Open/Close too.
Very minor label tweak in Tuning Editor (one line instead of two lines).
