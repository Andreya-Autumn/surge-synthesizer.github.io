Make surge-testrunner fail if resources not positioned (#6734)

Current surge-testrunner has some tests which assume the
runner is run from CWD=root of surge (so "resources/" is a good
local reference). We should probably fix that one day maybe

But for now make it error out if a candidate test file isn't
there but since you can select single tests and they work,
also give an env for workaround.
