Update dark skin FX grid asset, minor tweaks to FX grid (#4864)

Add hover skin colors on scene boxes in FX grid
Adjust the width of scene boxes in FX grid
Slightly tweak the name of Zam waveshaper

Addresses #2446

* Force GUI window size in dark skin XML

Since dark skin doesn't need GUI window size adjustment,
make sure to use the current window size before increasing
the width for Classic skin in a separate commit.

* Slightly adjust the horizontal position of FX grid in dark skin

* Remove boxes from FX grid SVGs (Classic and Dark skins) since they're drawn in code anyways
