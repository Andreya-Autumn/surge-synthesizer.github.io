Accesibility Quantized Arrow Keys with Command (#6864)

1. Make 'Command' the Quantized key consistently in ally and mouse
2. Actually respond to it in the modulatable slider, albeit with
   a pretty hacky way (see the comment there)
3. Fix a problem with size-one wavetables and quantized drags

Closes #6593
