First pass at Filter Deactivation (#5169)

Filters and Waveshapers can be deactivated. I used
the consistent UI gesture of RMB/Deactivate RMB/Activate
and opacity .5 the associated widgets when deactivated.

Addresses #5134. Probably good enough to call it done too
but i bet we will do some UI tweaks like explicit colors and
stuff.
