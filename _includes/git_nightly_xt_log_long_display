CMake: Refactor into subdirectories, projects

Our CMakeLists.txt is pushing 1.5k lines of spaghetti and has become
unmaintainable. This change splits Surge into subprojects to try and:

- Increase readability (targets & properties instead of variables)
- Reduce and gain insight into dependencies
- Reduce redundancy, potential for regressions and merge conflicts
- Make building things optional via SURGE_BUILD_* cache variables

Behavior shouldn't have changed too noticeably. Some targets were merged
or renamed to declutter the IDE a bit. The pluginval stuff still needs
cleaning up, but I didn't want to make this even bigger.
