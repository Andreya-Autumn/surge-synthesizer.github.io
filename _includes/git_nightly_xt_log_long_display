Keyboard for Edit; Edit Keys can follow mouse (#6240)

1. Alt-V opens the value editor on a focused component
   which supports value edits.
2. The focused component can be either the keyboard focus
   (the default) or if you opt in, the mouse hover focus.
   This applies to all edit gestures (Shift-F10, Arrow, AltV)

Closes #6233
