Alpha first cut of Twist/Plaits (#4010)

This is a very first cut of the "Twist" oscillator
based on the eurorack plaits. There is just so much still
to do as outlined in #3810 but I want to get something
merged and into folks hands now the core sample rate
issue is resolved. But still no LPG, no aux output,
no smoothed modulation, no good UI.
