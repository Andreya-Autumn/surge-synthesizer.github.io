Remove Surge::Error class

It was used both as an exception (without subclassing std::exception!)
as well as some sort of "canned error message box" via its "title"
property.

Window titles don't belong in exceptions, and Surge::Errors were handled
the same as "real" exceptions, except that for the latter, message box
titles were given at the catch site. So let's just do that for all
exceptions and throw std::runtime_error instead.
