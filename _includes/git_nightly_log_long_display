Uniform and Defensive sample rate in SFX (#4131)

SurgeFX would read sampleRate from whatever was hanging around
which in the init path could leave things messy. Move the SR setting
into storage (since SFX doesn't have a synth instance) and
make sure in the constructor before we do anything we have it
set either to the lingering value in case we are in a process
or at least a default before we start playing

Closes #4097
