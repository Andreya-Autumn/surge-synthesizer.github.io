Content update for 1.8.1 (#3721)

Add updated and optimized patches by TNMG
Add Luna's paraphonic cutoff warp patch
Add Stefan Singer patches
Add TNMG's modulator and FX presets
Rename Oscillators to Templates in Jacky's folder (for consistency)
Remove extraneous descriptions of Jacky's plucks (other patches don't really do it, so it's for consistency)
Update the mod presets menu creation to put subfolders before files, and also deal with & on Windows
