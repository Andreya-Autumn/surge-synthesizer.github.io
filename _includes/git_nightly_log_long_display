Restore the RNG by reviewing all thread usages (#4242)

So the RNG in storage is ONLY valid on the audio thread. But turns
out we had been careful enough to do that in all my tests, which is
good. So

1: Document that we are only good in the audio thread
2: Add a debug flag set which lets us check this
3: Remove the static and threadlocal
4: Turn on the Storage-local RNG again
