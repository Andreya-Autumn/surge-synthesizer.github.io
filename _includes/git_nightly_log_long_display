Address some of the races UI <-> Audio (#4259)

As shown in #4038, there's race conditions between the audio thread
and the UI thread under automation - which is a bummer.

This fixes most of the ones the oscillators showed. The FX is harder.
It also leaves my stress test code in place ifdefed out.
