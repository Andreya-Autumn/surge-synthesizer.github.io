First pass of tuning-aware filters (#3866)

Tuning aware filters read the SCL/KBM for setting cutoff frequency.
This is a first incomplete checkpoint towards the feature. It is
incomplete because

1. Primarily I am not 100% sure it is correct, but also
2. The display of filter values is still 12-TET
