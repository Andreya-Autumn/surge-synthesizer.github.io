Tuning aware filter improvements (#3880)

1. Add menu and gesture to set cutoff to keytrack root

To accurately use SCL/KBM tuned comb filters you need
to set the cutoff root to the keytrack root. This provides
gestures (Alt-DCLK in non-tuned filter mode, DCLK in tuned
filter mode, and a menu item in either case) to allow that.

2. Only retune filters in RETUNE_ALL mode since in
   RETUNE_MIDI_ONLY they are OK, but leave the backout
   implemented (which is why this is addresses, not closes
   the issue below)
