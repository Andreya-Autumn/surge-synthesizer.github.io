A more complete filter analyzer (#3432)

This is a more complete filter analysis tool. Lets you make
plots if you have python3, matplotlib, pandas standard setup.

To use it

1. build headless
2. Run `surge-headless --non-test --filter-analyzer 5 0 > filter5_0_out.dat` where
   5 and 0 are the filter type and subtype
3. Run `python3 scripts/misc/filterPdfPack.py filter5_0out.dat out.pdf`

and out.pdf will have analysis plots
