Fix Exciter Bug running over End of Sample Memory (#4315)

The drive multiply application accidentally applied at oversample
size not at sample size, but worked on the non-versampled data
so it caused a buffer overrun. In FXSend 2 slot (the last slot in
the storage) this caused a crash. (In other slots it would cause a
overwrite of the next buffer but that would get fixed by the next
buffer process)

Closes #4313
