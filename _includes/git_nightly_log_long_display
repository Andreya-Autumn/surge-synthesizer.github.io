Filter Indirection and Rename step 1: Tests (#3327)

This commit streams a bunch of SV14 patches with each filter
configuration available as of 6571f4a, makes a file with all
filters set to the type/subtype, streams it, comments out that
streamer, checkjs in the patches, and then loads it and
makes sure it loads OK. This is groundwork for changing the
enum / name of the filters and making sure we can test
old filters load.
