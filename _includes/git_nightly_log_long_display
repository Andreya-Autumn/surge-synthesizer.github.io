Different saturators, oversampling, and optimisation for NL Feedback Filter (#3301)

* Add different saturators, oversampling, and optimisation for Nonlinear Feedback filter.
* Adjust NLFB filter oversampling gain to be more consistent with non-oversampled
* Add comment about why (probably) oversampling doesn't work for anything other than lowpass
