Toggling touchscreen mode retains previously used mouse settings (#3888)

Instead of destructively changing mouse speed and show cursor while editing options when enabling Touchscreen mode, add a showCursor function that tests whether Show cursor while editing or Touchscreen mode options were enabled and act upon it then. Mouse speed using Exact mode was already solved in CSurgeSlider by querying buttons.isTouch().
