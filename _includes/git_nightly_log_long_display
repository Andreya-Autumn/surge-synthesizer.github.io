MSEG LFO Mode and Other Fixes (#3206)

Addresses #2966

1. Draw endpoints together at the end give you points
2. LFO Mode: Swapping compresses and decompresses
3. Move the duration offset functions into the MSEGModHelper
   so we can adapt them
4. Constraints preserved on draw mode moves
5. Remove loop markers and disable menus in LFO mode
