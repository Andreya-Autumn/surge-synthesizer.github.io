A structured multi-overlay API (#3630)

editorOverlay is now a list so you can have multiple, and the
tags which identify it are an enum so you know the overlay classes
and can write less buggy code, and generallly everything is better.

Although there is inevitably more work we want to do on overlays
and positioning, this commit makes the API a good enough starting
point to add other overlays, so it Closes #3223
