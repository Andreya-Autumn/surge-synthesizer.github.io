Fix a VST3 Operation Order Issue / API Issue (#4126)

The VST3 API passes me a value I want to stringify on a param.
I was ignoring that value and using the built-in value. This means
if you call getString before you call Set you appear to be off-by-one-tick
but if you call Set before getString you seem fine.

Bitwig calls getString before Set.

So this, defacto, fixes bitwig tiny resolution problem.

Closes #3818
