MSEG Checkpoint - Pan Alpha (#3077)

This is an initial implementation of PAN controls. Basically
horizontal mouse wheel pans as does click and drag on the background.
Even though it is incomplete I want to merge it since I don't
think I'll finish zoom this weekend and want to stay close to
merged.
