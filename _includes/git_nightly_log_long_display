Move the Bipolar and IsMenu check into parameter (#4107)

* Move the Bipolar and IsMenu check into parameter

Rather than having a long list of special cases in SGE,
have a long list of data conditions in Parameter.
But trust me, this is better. Will let us make these
features dynamic like name is.

* Also re-work bipolarity so it is dybamically queried
by the slider through a lambda. Closes #4108
