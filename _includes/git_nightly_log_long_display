Run all VLFOs with Envelope Triggers (#3823)

If a SS had an envlope trigger and was not otheriwse bound
to the modulation array it didn't run. Since the envelope trigger
is a 'hidden' modulation (that is, it is treated differently
than the float modulations), detect it and set that LFO as
being one which is required.
