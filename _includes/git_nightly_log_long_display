Patch browser frame now matches the dimensions of the frame used on the background
"Creator" changed to "Author" in patch browser for consistency with patch store dialog
Positioning of Creator/Author labels adapts to the height of patch browser

Renamed global.master_volume skin color to global.volume
Added developer menu option to use F5 key for reloading current skin
