String IDs for images are case insensitive (#3134)

If you have a string ID (which means say you are an unnamed
asset whose name is implied in the skin engine) you are case
insensitive. Defacto means you can have HOVER00153.svg and it works.

This means you can't differ images in the default load image
directory just by case. But windows already means you can't
do that so its fine.

Closes #3109
