SMseg unwrapped Phase Initializion (#3629)

Unlike VLFOs SLFOs keep an instance around and re-call attack
at some times. This had the odd impact of, in some cases,
the 'unwrapped int part' of phase not being set properly
(not in freerun but in other modes) in SLFOs which led to
unpredictable results.
