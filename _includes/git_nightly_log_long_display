Add Phaser/Neuron rate deactivation (scrub LFO phase) (#3982)

Right-click Deactivate will kill the LFO and turn Rate slider into a phase scrubber, so that the control can be modulated internally via modulators or externally via host automation.
Flanger implementation would benefit from finishing #3770 first.
Closes #2465

Also fixed a bug where bringing Spread parameter in thee phaser to 0% would only result in modulation happening in left channel only (which is not expected behavior).
