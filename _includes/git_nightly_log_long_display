Defer MSEG Open until Valid UI state on restore (#3466)

When restoring from DAW extra state, in a few cases you could
show MSEG before the UI was ready. This lead to crashes in
LPX and probably eslewhere. So have the loadFromDawExtra set a toggle
which open or idle uses to pop the mseg at the right time.

Closes #3465
