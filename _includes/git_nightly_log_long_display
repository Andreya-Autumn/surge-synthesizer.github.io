SurgeXT: Allow raw juce components in hierarchy easily (#4311)

1. Reorganize the CView base classes a little so the CView
   has a more owned- vs isa- relationship with its juce component
2. Add a mechanims to CViewContainer to take owhership of a component
   which was directly added
3. Add an exapmle to this in the juce debug branch of SGE which
   shows us adding a clickable juce build label which, of course,
   we will remove eventually and is only on in debug builds anyway
