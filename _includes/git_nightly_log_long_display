More MSEG Book of Work (#3413)

- Update model if you load patch with editor open
- LFO sustain point guarantees at least one loop
- Nodes always right clickable even when edging outside draw area
- Draw mode initiates only in draw area, so axis zoom works in drawmode
- Don't draw ticks which are outside the draw area, making the lines
  and so on dissapear appropriately
