Fix Alias in 32 bit mode (#4154)

In 32bit, int is 4 not 8 wide, so those casts to int in the limit_range
did the wrong thing. Ideally, as in #4153, we would use a templated
limit_range, but bit late in cycle for that, so temporarily add
a localClamp template function and cast to uint32_t uniformly.
