Split all the Filters and adjust stremaing and UI (#3329)

1. Split filters by types more granularly
2. Stream accordingly (including ff_revision bump)
3. Adjust stremaing regtests
4. Make a streaming re-order map and apply it to the UI
5. Various fixes, renames, and restructures to make it hang together

This is a big change.

Closes #3006
