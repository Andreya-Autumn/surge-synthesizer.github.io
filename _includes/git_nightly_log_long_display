Move shared surge code to a library (#3200)

* Move shared surge code to a library

1: Only SurgeSynth and the UI needs to know plugin flavor (for
   automation and zoom)
2: So move all DSP code into the surge-shared lib which is no longer
   an interface
3: make airwindows actually standalone linkordered
