A number of tweaks on Alias oscillator (#4152)

* A number of tweaks on Alias oscillator
Bit Depth has its own ctype, range 1-8 bits, floating point
Bit Depth applied at the output of the oscillator rather than at phase accumulator
Restored <random> but seeded it with rand() instead of using a system call
Reference to number of waves not hard-coded anymore but resolved through `extern`

Additionally, renamed waveguide... to stringosc... where applicable

* Remove printf()

* Move bitcrush related local vars outside of per-sample process loop
