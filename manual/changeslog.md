# Surge changeslog

This document is maintained by hand. Every so often one of the devs does a 
`git cherry -v upstream/1.6.0-beta-6 master` or 
`git cherry -v upstream/release/1.6.0-beta-5 upstream/release/1.6.0-beta-6` and 
makes sure the document is updated.

* Wavetable Next/Previous arrows work accurately and allow for scanning through each and every wavetable in the wavetables-folder.
* Switching patches no longer crashes
* Storing of patches works - if you write on Name and click on Category - the Name no longer reverts to"previous name". Same with Category, Creator, Comment.
* If you try to overwrite a patch that already exists, you will get an informative prompt to the tone of "this preset x already exists, are you sure?" (Mac and Win).

* If you Clear All binds from a Modulation box (Bind Cutoff, Clear All) - the Modulation box updates to "-", no longer stays as "Cutoff" even with no bind.
* Polyphony count was inaccurate and updated only when the area was clicked, now updates in real time.
