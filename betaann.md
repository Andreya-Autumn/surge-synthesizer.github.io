We are looking to enlist folks to help us test Surge 1.8. Download the beta
<a href="/nightly">here</a>.

In the 6 months since Surge 1.7 was released we've spent a lot of time adding
some really substantial features. Among them

- A fully featured MSEG modulator and editor
- A large number of new filter types
- Many of the Airwindows effects in the FX chain
- Substantial graphics improvements
- And a lot more

We've also had several new devs join the team! So now we are getting ready
to ship Surge 1.8 in early/mid January 2021, and we need your help beta testing.

If you would like to beta test, it's easy. Here's how you do it

1. Download the latest nightly beta from https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/nightly
2. Install it and play it!
3. Something seem wrong or broken? Let us know, preferably in the #bug-reports 
   channel on our discord or by opening a github issue, but you can reach us other
   ways too.

If you do find a problem, please share the version of Surge you are running. This
is now super easy. Open the about screen, click "Copy Version Info", and paste that
text into your bug report.

There are a few areas where we are esepcially looking for testers. Please especially
consider trying the beta:
- If you use Windows, HDPI, and Live
- If you are running on Mac Silicon (the 18 release will be fat but we don't have the h/w
  although do have confirmation it works just fine)
- If you are using a somewhat less mainstram DAW (we regularly test in Bitwig, Reaper, Logic, Live,
  FL, Ardour and a few others)
- If you know your environment is somehow odd and want to make sure it works
- If you suspect your enviroment is perfectly normal, and still want to make sure it works!

At this time the beta is mostly complete. We have some smaller issues to address still
and critically we are still doing a bit of work on the AllPass and "NL" filters (which
may even get a different name). But patches made with the beta will work with 1.8 and
all the filters are fair game for testing.

We're very excited for Surge 1.8, but it is really hard to fully test a synth in a volunteer
project in the numerous environments we support. If you have some time over the end of year
and would like to help make Surge great, please do consider giving the beta a whirl and let 
us know what you find.
