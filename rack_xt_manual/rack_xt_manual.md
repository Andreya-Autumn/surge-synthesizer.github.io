Surge XT is a collection of modules for VCV Rack which brings the majority of the DSP code
from the synth into the Rack environment in a modern, carefully designed fashion.

This manual documents the modules, but a great starting  point if you are impatient is to just
watch our beta-day launch video from Omri Cohen:

One of our biggest open items between now and the 1.0 library release is to write this manual.
